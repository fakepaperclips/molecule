Arduinos are amazing devices, but even with the incredible community surrounding them, there still seems to be  a huge lack of women interested in low-level programming. I wondered if this was because often, the only embedded application people know about is robots. Inspired by Lily Buechley’s Lilypad Arduinos, I wanted to show how to use Arduinos for a different kind of application, and designed an event around what I created. Questions I want to ask:


### questions

  - **Crafting as entry-point into STEM** For those who do use Arduino, what is the entry point? For me, it was crafting – is that a common experience? Programming is really about problem-solving, which is a valuable skill for anyone – so how can we emphasize that and generate interest among people with different backgrounds? Leah Buechley’s wonderful Lilypad taps into the crafting, as does Jie Qi’s Circuit Stickers. Bioengineering seems like a field that is ripe for exploration.
  - **Social computing** This event really emphasized social connection. The Qbadges were used to initiate conversations, and the women worked in groups to solve the programming challenges. We got a lot of positive feedback about this aspect, and identified some extremely strong candidates who we wanted to interview. How could we incorporate a social component into the interviewing process? What problems would that cause for cross-cultural interviews?
  - **Support deep interaction** The “networking” portion of the event compared survey answers between participants. My goal was to spark conversation about the specific topics, but we found that people used it mainly to get a “snapshot” of how compatible they were. In other words, the pendant encouraged snap assessments rather than in-depth conversations. How can I use a platform like this as a jumping off point for more meaningful types of interactions? Or was the novelty of the experience enough to initiate a connection? How do successful networkers build a connection – are there themes we can identify?
  - **Tangible interfaces** The physicality of the object was important to me – embodying the experience in an aesthetically pleasing pendant is far more interesting than interacting through a screen or an app. But why was that? What aspects of the physicality are important? In other words, where we draw the line between physical and digital is up to us: what kinds of interesting experiences can we create by drawing that line in different places? Take [the COSMAC ELF computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_ELF), for instance, which you can program by physically toggling switches. How else can we utilize the physical world to interact digitally, and how does that effect our experience?
