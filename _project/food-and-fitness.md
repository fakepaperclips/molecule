Prototype for a line of products that provide an activity (fitness, meditation, math problems, etc) during the time that food is being prepared.

This project was created as part of the [Critical Making course at UC Berkeley][critical-making]. 24 Second Food + Fitness is a way to maximize on the time wasted waiting for food to be ready. It provides a quick activity with each interaction, ensuring the user gets a little training in each day, and in a fun, engaging manner. The type of activity is completely customizable. The user could load a meditation program and get a minute of mindfulness every time they make their toast, or do some math problems while their lunch is heating up in the microwave. For the purposes of this provocation, we focused on the two most used appliances in a college kitchen: the microwave and toaster.
