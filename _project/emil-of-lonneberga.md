"I took my 7 year old Granddaugher. From the moment is began, she never moved! We both enjoyed every moment of the play! I was such a wonderful way to kick-off our holiday season. We have both still been talking about it! Thank you so much!Excellent! Debra" – [Goldstar review ][emil-review]

"Grandkids and I loved the story and puppets; even with the people behind the scenes, the puppets were the main focus." – [Goldstar review ][emil-review]

"This was a very sweet puppet show!" – [Goldstar review ][emil-review]

“[V]ery well done - the puppeteers that were very visible seemed invisible because they made the puppets so real looking.” – [Goldstar review ][emil-review]

"Very clever & fun! Adults may have even enjoyed it more than the kids, and I also LOVED the live musicians--really added that special touch to the performance!" – [Goldstar review ][emil-review]
