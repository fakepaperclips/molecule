Abstract
--------

This thesis analyzes perceptions towards collaborating with version control and
introduces a new system, CodePilot, for project-wide synchronous collaborative
programming backed by version control. We review our study of programmers using
the system to collaborate on web development tasks, and suggest that combining
synchronous collaborative programming with version control as asynchronous
collaboration is a novel, powerful paradigm in programmer collaboration. It not
only makes version control more accessible for novice programmers, but prompts
more experienced programmers to coordinate and parallelize their development
efforts.
