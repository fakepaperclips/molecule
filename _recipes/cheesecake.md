#### Ingredients
- 2.5 pounds of cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/3 Cup sugar
- 1/3 Cup sour cream
- 1/3 Cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 Tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 Tablespoons vanilla extract
- 2 large egg yolks
- 6 large whole eggs

#### Steps
1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
2. Mix heavy whipping cream into cream cheese.
3. Mix salt and half of sugar into cream cheese.
4. Mix in remaining sugar, beat for at least a minute.
5. Add sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix for another minute.
6. Add yolks and mix for a minute.
7. Add remaining eggs, two at a time, mixing between eggs.
8. Bake at 500 for 10 minutes.
9. Don't open oven door, and turn oven temperature down to 200.
10. Bake for another hour, maybe an hour and a half. It's done when a circle the size of a penny in the center jiggles a bit and nothing else does. The center should also measure 150 degrees.
11. Cool for 1.5-2 hours.
12. Put in fridge for at least 6 hours.
