### Abisko Östra
#### Abisko.net Hostel
#### Grocery store
We found a lot of conflicting information online about the availability of food in Abisko Östra. There is a great grocery store there, about a 10-minute walk down the hill from the Abisko.net hostel. Lots of fresh veggies, fresh fruit, milk, meat, cereal, bread, and TONS of candy. The extensive candy collection is because Norway has a high tax on sugar, so a lot of Norwegians make the drive to Abisko to purchase cheap candy and soda. 
#### Lake
#### Dogsledding
We did the <a href="http://www.abisko.net/dogsled/">2-hour dogsledding trip provided by abisko.net</a> and it was phenomenal. 1600SEK/person. You help load the dogs onto the sleds, and they take you along a beautiful path with an incredible view of the mountains. You get to spend a lot of time cuddling with the dogs, and a lot of time riding the sledges. They stop twice, so if you want to swap who is sitting in front you have two chances. The stops are in areas that are fairly photogenic (what in Abisko isn't?) but not the absolute best views. (I went out later on my own to get more pictures the next day).
#### vs Abisko Turiststation
We didn't spend much time in TuristStation, so take this with a grain of salt, but it felt much "fancier" and more organized than Östra (hence, we preferred Östra). There also didn't seem to be a grocery store (though the restaurant at the STF hostel was better and more affordable than the restaurants we found in Östra). Access to the lake was better in Östra - in TuristStation it was down a much longer steeper hil. Access to the train station was equally good in both.
### Abiskojaure STF Fjällstation

## Travel

### To and from Arlanda airport

### From Kiruna Airport
As of this writing, there is only one bus from Kiruna airport to Abisko. It is the 91, and it departs Kiruna Airport at 2:15pm daily (the airport is the end of the line, and the first stop). Tickets from Kiruna Airport to Abisko Östra are 200SEK/person (payable by credit card). The first stop after the airport is the Kiruna Bus Station, which is where you may be able to transfer to the SJ train to Abisko but we did not do this. You can also take a taxi all the way to Abisko for ~1800SEK. Buying a ticket in advance is no guarantee that you will get on the bus - it's first-come-first-serve. In March, there were a total of 8 people on the bus, so it wasn't a problem (but you may want to wait outside in the line if you arrive in summer). (If the bus had been full, our back-up plan was to take a 15-minute taxi ride to the Kiruna Bus Station and catch the SJ train to Abisko, but I'm not 100% certain it would have worked since we didn't purchase a ticket in advance). There is room in the bottom of the bus to store your luggage, and a bathroom onboard.

There are also shuttle services, for about 450SEK/person. The advantage of these is that they leave earlier than the 91, so you don't need to spend 4 hours in the Kiruna airport.

### Train
We rode the 18-hour train back to Stockholm. Logistically, taking the train down is easier because you don't need to coordinate your flight frp, Kiruna with the bus back to Kiruna, or hire an expensive taxi (~1800SEK). Instead, it's a leisurely walk to the train station in either Abisko Östra or Abisko Turistation. Since we were staying in Abisko Östra, we took a walk across the frozen lake to get back. It was windy and cold, but we eventually made it to the Abisko Turiststation STF accommodations, which offer an excellent buffet for 125SEK/person. We also spent about an hour of time in the wonderful nature museum. There were a bunch of excellent documentaries in English, and some lovely displays about the surrounding area.

The overnight train from Abisko to Stockholm is run by a company called "SJ". 
- You MUST <a href="https://www.sj.se/en/home.html#/">purchase tickets online in advance.</a> They do not sell tickets on the train.
- Double-check that you are purchasing the tickets for the right date ;)
- The 3-person cars are VERY small and difficult to spend much time in.
- The 6-person cars are wonderful and roomy if you only have 3 people, but very cramped with all 6.
- The seats in the sitting cars don't really recline, but you can often spread out a bit and lay across several seats.
- There is not really a viewing car.
- The dining car has pre-made sandwiches, milk, pastries, and other "train food".
