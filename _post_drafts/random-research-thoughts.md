If there's one aspect of the design that stands out, users will latch onto that. 
Ex: movement for Alterwear displays.

Users really need to see final working prototypes, in-situ, w/ as much specific details as possible to fully imagine.

Just asking users to brainstorm for you feels....shitty.
I need to read more about running good/fruitful user studies.

Another way to reward participants...can we send them the paper once it's published? Does that violate IRB? What if we invite people to "sign up to be notified when a paper is published" and then they're not necessarily users, they're interested parties. Could also be useful for publicity. Basically a hyper-specific citation notification service.

More follow-ups in recruiting surveys:
	- Asked if they used trackers, some specified no, could have asked a follow up here (does that bias it too much?)

Cesar's user study feedback
	- Think about why you're choosing this quote.
	- Someone reading this paper should think "oh that's exactly my user, let me see what issues they ran into". Stu is someone who has a lot of familiarity w/ the X/Y process, what is similar/where do they diverge? Something like "I can do things with this machine I couldn't do before" can be summarized in the quantitative Likert scales. Or, if you don't have enough participants to report numbers, say it in the qualitative section: 5/6 of the participants said they could do things they could do before.
	- What are the things that other people can take away, if they want to build devices like these. "Oh I really need it to be visual" "I love how tactile it is"
	- You should always do a Likert scale. The only way you can get feedback without you introducing social desireability bias. Make sure you let them fill out this part without you watching/hovering/knowing their answers.


AlterWear 2.0:
	- Specific Likert scale re:
		- Battery use
		- Whether tagging gesture feels intimate
