### Terms
WOF: Weight of Fiber. THe weight of the dry fiber, used to calculate how much dye/mordant should be used. [source: Maiwa](http://maiwahandprints.blogspot.com/2010/11/natural-dyes-weight-of-fibre.html)

### Scouring
Scour the fabric to remove oils, chemicals, or anything that could cause a barrier between the fiber and the dye. For cellulose fibers (cotton, etc), synthrapol is common. For protein fibers (silk, wool), orvus soap paste is used.[1, 2]

Orvus paste is typically 100% sodium lauryl sulfate (sheep shampoo), with no surfectants or other ingredients[3]. Other detergents like common dish soaps contain sodium lauryl sulfate, but they also have silicones and other ingredients, which can coat fibers and prevent dye from adhering. 

I'm using clarifying shampoo, since it is meant to not deposit anything into my hair, so I think it should be suitable for not depositing into the fabric as well.

### Mordant

Soak the fabric in appropriate solution of mordant at least overnight. No need to rinse.

#### Alum – <b>Potassium aluminum sulfate</b> 
The mordant most frequently used by dyers for protein (animal) and cellulose (plant) fibres and fabrics. It improves light and washfastness of all natural dyes and keeps colours clear. It is inexpensive and safe to use. This form of alum is refined from bauxite, the raw state of aluminum ore, and is free from the impurities (such as iron) some other alums can contain.[4]

<b>Use at 12-20% WOF.</b> Mordant once with alum at 15% WOF and then again with a fresh mordant bath of alum at 15% WOF. A tannin/alum/alum mordant achieves slightly richer colours.[4]

Cream of tartar also increases the uptake of alum into the fabric, and "brightens" the colors.[11]

#### Process
Use enough water that the fabric can move freely. Approx. 3 litres (6 pints) of water to 100 gr of fabric.[11]
Slowly bring to a boil, and simmer for ~45 minutes.

From Maiwa [15]:
- Weigh the fibre dry, then scour.
- Measure alum at 15% WOF
- Measure cream of tartar at 6% WOF (optional, see cream of tartar, mordants part 1).
- Dissolve both the alum and the cream of tartar in very hot water in a non-reactive container.
- Add the dissolved chemicals to the dye kettle with enough warm water 45º C (110º F) to cover the fibre when it is added - usually a 30:1 ratio of water to fibre. Stir well.
- Add the scoured, wet fibre. Over 30-45 minutes bring the temperature up to 90º C (195ºF) Just under simmer for wool, and 85ºC (185ºF) for silk. Hold for one hour, gently turning the fibre regularly. 
- Let cool in the bath for 20 minutes. 
- Remove the fibre from the mordant bath. Allow to hang evenly over a non-reactive rod (stainless steel, plastic) until it stops dripping. Rotate the yarn or fabric frequently so the alum is evenly distributed. 
- Store the yarn or cloth in a damp white cloth for 24-48 hours. Keep it damp during this entire period if proceeding to dyeing. If you are going to store the fibre longer, then it needs to dry completely and then be stored in a dark place.


#### Copper
Copper wire in one part water, one part vinegar. Ready to use when blue. [10]

#### Black beans
Soak dry beans in water for 24 hours.[9] 

### Dye bath
For an immersion dye bath, roll the cloth or paper over copper pipe, tree branch, wood dowel, plastic pipe, etc., folding as needed[5].
Don't put the fabric into hot water as it can "shock" it. Put it into cold water instead, and let them heat up together.
Head water bath up to 80 degrees C / 180 F and then keep at that temperature for 45 minutes. [13]

### Dyes

Eucalyptus leaves dipped in vinegar and then tightly bound to fabric makes a deep red pattern.[6] Different leaves give many different colors, in many different situations. Leaves dried on the ground are different from fresh, for example, as are all different species.[7] I believe the ones I have near me in the hills of Berkeley are "Blue Gum Eucalyptus" (Eucalyptus globulus) [8]
Avocado skin and seed make pink. Skins will tend to give colors that are redder whilst pits give oranges and apricots.[14] Five or six large avocados for 100 grams of wool will give a lovely light-to-medium pink shade. You will need many more for deeper colors.
Onion skins make a deper pink or orange.
Black tea makes a brown probably
Turmeric makes brilliant yellow but will likely fade.
Coffee can make brown.
Cochineal - fuschia (unless w/ cream of tartar in mordant, which will make it "true red"). Iron at 2-4% WOF pushes it towards purple. You will need only 3-8% WOF for a medium depth of shade.  The cochineal rich red can be shifted to orange with the addition of an acid (vinegar) and to a deep fuschia with the addition of an alkaline (soda ash).  See PDF for prep instructions.  [16]

### Plan
#### Pink and red
- Alum mordant
- Background: Avocado skin / seeds (pink)
- Other colors: Red onion skin (red), Eucalyptus leaves.

#### Yellows and Orange
- Alum mordant
- Background: Tea (light yellow?)
- Other colours: Yellow onion skins, turmeric?, eucalyptus? 

#### Yellows and Brown
- Alum mordant
- Background: Coffee? Eucalyptus bark?[12]
- Other colours: eucalyptus and rust?

#### Blue
- Alum mordant + copper mordant
- Background: Black beans + copper

#### 
- Iron mordant? And alum mordant?
- Background: red onion?
- Other colours: cochineal
