### Terms
WOF: Weight of Fiber. THe weight of the dry fiber, used to calculate how much dye/mordant should be used. [source: Maiwa](http://maiwahandprints.blogspot.com/2010/11/natural-dyes-weight-of-fibre.html)

### Scouring
Scour the fabric to remove oils, chemicals, or anything that could cause a barrier between the fiber and the dye. For cellulose fibers (cotton, etc), synthrapol is common. For protein fibers (silk, wool), orvus soap paste is used.[1, 2]

Orvus paste is typically 100% sodium lauryl sulfate (sheep shampoo), with no surfectants or other ingredients[3]. Other detergents like common dish soaps contain sodium lauryl sulfate, but they also have silicones and other ingredients, which can coat fibers and prevent dye from adhering. 

I'm using clarifying shampoo, since it is meant to not deposit anything into my hair, so I think it should be suitable for not depositing into the fabric as well.

### Mordant

Soak the fabric in appropriate solution of mordant at least overnight. No need to rinse.

#### Alum â€“ <b>Potassium aluminum sulfate</b> 
The mordant most frequently used by dyers for protein (animal) and cellulose (plant) fibres and fabrics. It improves light and washfastness of all natural dyes and keeps colours clear. It is inexpensive and safe to use. This form of alum is refined from bauxite, the raw state of aluminum ore, and is free from the impurities (such as iron) some other alums can contain.[4]

<b>Use at 12-20% WOF.</b> Mordant once with alum at 15% WOF and then again with a fresh mordant bath of alum at 15% WOF. A tannin/alum/alum mordant achieves slightly richer colours.[4]

#### Copper
Copper wire in one part water, one part vinegar. Ready to use when blue. [10]

#### Black beans
Soak dry beans in water for 24 hours.[9]

### Dye bath
For an immersion dye bath, roll the cloth or paper over copper pipe, tree branch, wood dowel, plastic pipe, etc., folding as needed[5].
Don't put the fabric into hot water as it can "shock" it. Put it into cold water instead, and let them heat up together.

### Dyes

Eucalyptus leaves dipped in vinegar and then tightly bound to fabric makes a deep red pattern.[6] Different leaves give many different colors, in many different situations. Leaves dried on the ground are different from fresh, for example, as are all different species.[7] I believe the ones I have near me in the hills of Berkeley are "Blue Gum Eucalyptus" (Eucalyptus globulus) [8]
Avocado skin and seed make pink.
Onion skins make a deper pink or orange.
Black tea makes a brown probably
Turmeric makes brilliant yellow but will likely fade.
Coffee can make brown.

### Plan
#### Pink and red
- Background: Avocado skin / seeds (pink)
- Other colors: Red onion skin (red), Eucalyptus leaves.

#### Yellows and browns
- Background: Tea (light yellow?)
- Other colours: Yellow onion skins, turmeric?, eucalyptus? Brown?

#### Blue
- Background: Black beans + copper
