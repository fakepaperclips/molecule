Install react: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

Install node, which comes with npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Or using the nvm (node version manager): https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

React Native doesn't work with v. 5, you have to install v. 4: ``` npm install -g npm@4 ```

Following the instructions, I used Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows: https://chocolatey.org/install#install-with-cmdexe

Forget all that. If you want to design for iOS you have to eventually install xcode. On Windows, that means installing a VM w Mac OSX on it and......I'm no longer interested. THat's literally setup hell wrapped in setup hell. I switched to a mac.
