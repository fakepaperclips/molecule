"Agent" --> implies 'intelligence' or at least something that tries to be intelligent. Relates to Horvitz' Principles of Mixed-Initiative User Interfaces. "anticipate needs" - this is super super hard to do.

Raskin would say a system like this is inhumane: unpredictable and customizable.

"see what the user sees" probably not, tho...and slight differences are, I think, jarring enough to cause problems. Uncanny valley of world interpretation?

RA uses user's recent searches and learns their context (autocorrect can be annoying when it does this). BUt more philosophically, what does it mean for computer systems to always be reflecting our own thoughts/work/etc back at us? I don't see a discussion of a system explicitly pointing out a question that you're not asking, as an instructor or parent might do. The author says the system may identify connections we don't think of - would this actually be helpful? Or would it be so weird that it wouldn't fit into our conceptualization of usefulness? Also even making that decision takes mental effort - I question how seamlessly this fits into lives, and especially how little it disrupts the natural flow of human conversation.

"Different styles of wearable computing hardware" that is not how I would caption this photograph:

!["different styles" of wearable computing][different-wearable-styles]

Love the focus on what "computers do well". 
Question whether "remember" is the right description for what the computer is helping the user do. Remembering is something that happens inside, does this really count? On the other hand maybe you can leverage recognition rather than recall and get more? How would this change how people process information?

Transfer of RA to others: Memex dream come true!!!

Example of "How do I reboot a Sun workstation?" SO real SO close to my heart would LOVE to get a top 10 list
Types of info that can't be captured this way? what is left out?

LOOVE the museum example - reminds me the most of memex stuff I think.

#### Project Jacquard: Interactive Digital Textiles at Scale
Poupyrev, Ivan, et al. "Project Jacquard: interactive digital textiles at scale." Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 2016.
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2858036.2858176

Focus on manufacturing affordability/ease (addressing some messiness concerns of Dourish and Bell)

"for designers of those objects, digital sensing and computation become basic properties of the textile materials—like weight, color and elasticity."

Love the details about existing yarn types. Sometimes I think about how these documents will be useful to historians but not always in obvious ways that we think.

Reading papers is frustrating becauase i have to flip back and forth to the citations. PDFs are terrible.

Oh cool they talk about their inspiration! " Project Jacquard was inspired by observing that the structure of woven textiles strongly resembles the structure of the multitouch sensor panels used in today’s mobile phones and tablets with projected capacitive sensing: both are based on grid topology"

list of requirements: daaaaaaaaamn
" we were not aware of existing yarns that could satisfy all these requirements" so we built one motherfuckerssssss

Holy shit this paper.
