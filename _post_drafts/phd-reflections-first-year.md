#### Thoughts on my first year of PhD
- Intense feeling of doing everything wrong, but not at all sure of how to do things right.
- Feeling that you're already too late, and you need to commit to a project as soon as possible and "make it work" to get all the pressure off your back.
- "Secret trades" - secret trade-offs you're making with your professor, where you mentally "agree" to do what they ask in exchnage for having a break/time to feel unpressured and think about what you want to do for research instead. (hint: this will never work).
- Too much focus on classwork, and a lack of understanding of what it is.
- A sense that you are completely lost and have no idea what even counts as research, or how to begin.

- Your first few projects will be nonsense, and they will also probably involve regurgitating something from your past. In my case, after a year of Critical Making-style "class project"-feeling work, I finally started doing something more interesting....and it's accidentally CogSci-style research experiments. I wonder if I'll just keep moving back in time.

- A feeling that you just don't even understand the field. For me, this faded dramatically after studying for and taking Prelims. 

- Recurring questions: "What counts as research?" "What IS research?" "How do I 'do' research?"
