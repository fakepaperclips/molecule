1. Footage on the new thing of a stepper motor going 
Moves up and down, cut to arduino, type something in, it does something different
Slap dragon teeth on it, program a dragon's mouth to open/close
Point: motors a: difficult to program, tedious, compile cycle, 
b: it's all about context, what you put it on that determines how things should be programmed

Then: 2 stepper motors, and 2 dragons talking to each other, design behaviors to be speech so they can talk to each other, gets at interleaving commands (programming that by hand would be nightmare)
2d dragon cut-out.

Baby 
Shots of stepper motors moving, to get that footage



2. 6 cardboard-to-relay connections
was doing w/ magnets one on the bottom one on the top.
