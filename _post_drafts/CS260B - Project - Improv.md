#### Notes
- "Everyone writes down what I do, but not how." - Keith Johnson
- Strong resistance to the notion that Improv has "rules"
  - art cannot be quantified, and improv is an art
  - you "know it" when you see it. 
  - rules are for beginners only, as you move along and become more advanced, you remove the rules.
  - The only rule: "Move forward, with everyone's joyful participation"
  
- "Learning as substance" transmitted from the teacher to the student as opposed to learning a process that the student embeds themselves in.

#### Rules
  - The only rule: "Move forward, with everyone's joyful participation"
  - Told the story of a beginning improv group playing the game of "one word story" and inevitably, someone will say two words (b/c they forgot, just slipped up, thought it would be funny, etc). And the BEGINNING group will pounce on them: "the rule is one word! You said two words!" whereas the more advanced group recognizes that the point isn't the RULES, the point is to PLAY. So maybe now the rules change to support this new form of play: it's a two-word story or whatever.
  - adv improvisors realize the rules are constraints, just there to let the game evolve.
  - Rules are to scaffold so you get through vulnerability, fear, and relax, breathe, and see.
    - "Yes, and"
    - Taking control: Coffee? Do you have tea? - Rather than accepting the coffee, the actor rejects the drink, taking control. Improv is about ceding control.
    - listening
    - self-efficacy
  - Saw a talk by researchers a while ago about improv rules, and he asked "which version of improv" because there are really no hard and fast rules. 
  
  
#### Worthwhile
  - When we perform a play, like Shakespeare, we automatically assume his words are "worth" saying onstage: they have value. The fact that a playwright wrote the words makes them *worthwhile* to perform. But when we're creating our own work, and especially in improv, a little part of ourselves is the playwright. So we must continually convince ourselves that we we're doing is worthwhile.
  - "Is that the role of the audience?" The audience provides a feedback loop that is critical to knowing if we're on the right track. But it's not that this is something performed for the audience, it's a co-production process, and the audience is a co-performer.
  - Too much laughter is not good. Theatre is all about crafting experiences, and you don't want to stay at the same level all the time. A roller-coaster with no dips would be no fun at all - even the kiddy coasters go up and down a bit. Theatre's job is to take people on a journey they wouldn'dt otherwise go on themselves. "I love a good cry" but I am not likely to just sit down and cry to myself for a while. But with a good show, I can.
  - Improv involves crafting a show piece by piece and since you don't know where it's going, at every given moment you must act *as if* it is right: you have to just convince yourself that what you're saying is worthwhile. 
  
#### Failure
  - Who determines failures? Us, the people around us, 
  - structural failure (too much focus on rules) vs self-defined failure (not being present, not being "in your body", being fearful, not being vulnerable, we create our own problems).
  - anything that stops the story from moving forward.
  - Exercise w/ saying something negative and an audience dings a bell when that happens.
