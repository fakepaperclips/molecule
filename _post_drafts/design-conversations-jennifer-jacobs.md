### Motivating computational tools
- Challenge: Brittleness of programming.
- Manual skills irrelevant / hard to translate to computation.
  - Not just learning barriers: even those v experienced w/ processing had similar complaints.
- LaurieFrick.com - manually-drawn sleep data --> more accessible/welcoming.
- Code as a tool to support analytic/reflective processes. (another lens through which to view art/process).
### Developing ""
- Designed new programming language along w/ design of IDE / interaction.
- Extended evaluation, integrated w/ development process.
### Evaluating ""
- Relationship building: a community of folks interested in new weird stuff is invaluable.
- Criteria: Diversity (primary; artist are dedicated to making good work w/ bad tools, so expressiveness is a good measure b/c can't just struggle towards one local hill, wide design space).
  - How often people can use a tool she develops to create something she didn't anticipate. Create something she didn't design for. If they try and fail, try to eliminate those barriers.
  - Select artist w/ different styles in a study and compare how much their work aligns w/ the work they do beforehand.
### Dynamic Brushes
- CHI, 2018
- SO COOL
### Thoughts
- Debugging as a process for creative reflection.
- performative: inspection/visualization not just for artist, but how to communicate that process to audiences. (another opportunity for engagement).
