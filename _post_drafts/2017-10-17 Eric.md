personal statement: 
  - how to make it exciting

research proposal:
  - "not really state of the art robotics" (references my split as I wrote the paper: started out as robotics, was going to add stuff about path-planning, SWARM coordination, etc. but then I segued w/ no transition to just "kinetic wearables")
  - emphasize how clothing alrady does this, and what's good about that, and how my stuff is recapturing and expanding on this existing aspect of wearables (clothing).
  - throwing down ideas on paper, finess word-choice later
  - "What are you really wanting to do?"
  - "Hang on what's really going on here?"
  - "This is not the right term but...."
