Meeting w/ Eric 29 August 2017

Capacitors are rated for how quickly they discharge. Might need a different one that discharges quickly enough.

Could then mock-up a bunch of buttons, could fit right into Jacquard story, programmable buttons.  (Where would I actually want to wear those...somewhere visible to me - maybe shoes?)

Two goals:
Magnet bistable
Scrunching, reveal the interface, weird bunching


Even just a little bit of bunching on the arms, as a signal (don't have time to do a user study to make sure people can actually feel it but yeah).
