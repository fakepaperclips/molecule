Worried about being put onto another project - not really a thing in HCI, and jumping onto an existing project is super super helpful early in your research career.

Worried about releasing code/etc into the wild, but academia is totally different. They already share knowledge with the world, and I can easily post things on Instructables w/ no concerns about.

### Thoughts from Grant Ho

 • Things to ask advisors during visit day
     ○ If you're interested in working with them, explicitly ask the faculty whether they will take you on as a student and what the funding situation will be (e.g., Would you be willing to be my advisor? Will you fund me as your student/how does funding work?)
       § I can't emphasize this one enough… Surprisingly, I've heard of students at several different universities who thought they had a great advisor match, but never explicitly asked. After arriving, they then realized that the professor wasn't interested in being the student's advisor, but rather collaborating from time to time.
    ○ Ask if they have ideas on future research visions for you and/or what things they're excited to work on in the future.
       § A huge part of your advisor's role is to 1) help you choose exciting + high impact problems and 2) inspire and motivate you even when things don't go well (e.g., a paper rejection). A good litmus test for this is to see whether you feel excited about research and working with them during your visit day meetings.
       § If you're particularly interested in a line of research, strike up a conversation about it and see if it feels like an exciting discussion or if it's not their cup of tea.
• Things to do during visit day
    ○ Talk to students from advisors you're interested in.
       § A huge part of your phd experience will be shaped by your labmates / student collaborators. You'll probably meet with your advisor for at most a few hours a week, but you'll spend many more hours sharing an office, bouncing ideas around, and collaborating with the other students. 
   ○ Talk to students who are FRIENDS OF/know the students & advisors you're interested in.
       § This will help you get an outside perspective on how happy and productive they are; I got some incredibly illuminating and unfiltered insights doing this at different visit days.
