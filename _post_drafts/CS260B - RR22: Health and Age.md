 ### Human-computer interaction for kids.
 
#### You are not your user
The fact that Teletubbies and Dora the Explorer are horrible experiences for adults, clarifies this experience perfectly. Contrast with Sesame Street, which is is fun for adults but maybe not as developmentally appropriate for kids as the other two. Interstingly, Sesame Street is often successfully used by adults in foreign countries to learn English, and I think it IS popular w/ kids. 
 
#### Slightly more universal? 
The discussions about motor limitations made me wonder if solutions for kids could map to solutions that support a broader population, like the elderly, or other motor impaired groups. Is this possible without again falling into the trap of "universal design" that avoids supporting specific users here? 
 
#### General research challenges
This seems to be a universal challenge of research: the authors describe a lot of work showing that kids can't double-click very well, but go on to lament the fact that a lot of kid-focused interfaces are designed w/ double-clicks in mind. This seems like a universal problem with the amount of information available to use today. Not even Vannevar could save us from this challenge!
 
#### Truly innovative interfaces
There's a lot of debate about what "intuitive" interfaces mean. Intuitive pretty much always seems to actually mean "familiar" which means they rely on previous knowledge of other interfaces. Consider, for instance, the "save icon", which is a floppy disk. But most young people have never even seen a floppy disk. Could working with kids prompt development of truly "intuitive" interfaces? What kinds of interfaces would we get if we started fresh w/ a population that is unfamiliar with GUIs?

#### I don't even know but it makes me....sad?

```
In one study with 12-year-olds and another
with 9- to 13-year-olds, they found that girls solve more
puzzles with a give protocol, but boys are more productive with
a take protocol (Inkpen, 1997; Inkpen et al., 1995).
```

#### Not necessarily helpful
Unclear guidelines for usability testing - I don't really feel like I understand how to do this w/ kids. The section just felt too vague and unclear to provide any guidance. I did enjoy Miller's suggestions later, as they seemed more concrete, as well as the design guidelines. 
 
 ### Designing for the "Universe of One": Personalized Interactive Media Systems for People with the Severe Cognitive Impairment Associated with Rett Syndrome.
 
 This work continues problematizing "universal design", and points out the specific challenges of designing for those with extreme disablities. I was surprised to read about the simple existing assistive tech, like an animatronic bear that's so boring even 6-month-olds don't want to play with it...I can't help but feel there must be more out there.
 
 #### Scaling up
 A few questions this work raised include: how can we scale this up? And are the costs and benefits of helping these few families a lot, vs helping a much larger population not very much? In particular, the proposed project ideas from the parents (like the button that would scroll through family pictures) seems ludicrously simple w/ existing tech nowadays (like the If This Then That button). Might it be possible to support a large variety of people with disabilities by providing workshops or systems to teach these kinds of skills? This seems like the only real way to scale up, rather than relying on research expertise...this seems especially relevant since the largest cost of development is maintenance rather than creation. If you teach the families to develop their own devices, and perhaps support a community of families all working on their own assistive technologies you might be able to avoid those issues.
 
 Related: if a given community of disabled folks doesn't have a family member who is an HCI researcher, how are they supposed to get access to this kind of researcher support? Furthermore, the paper didn't discuss ongoing support: what happens if (when?) the technology starts to breakdown? How will long-term tech support work in this case?
 
 #### Formatting nitpicks
 The italicized section headers were hard to read: I would have preferred if they were bolded. Also the charts seemed frankly unnecessary to me...and I am not at all clear on the purpose of the "time-on-topic" measure. Is this included for a reason?
