#### NSF GRFP
Recommenders (Eric + _______? )
	- Anca? Gail? Ken? Bjoern? Armando? Shewchuk?
	- Gail, pro (she knows you and can write overwhelming positive things about the general creative genius), con: doesn't know too much about technical thing (eric can vouch for that), and she might not know how to write them.
	- Jill (same as Gail) (should possibly be someone ladder-ranked)
	- Armando (took class w/ him as undergrad, wrote rec letter for grad student, aced his class, organization skills, doing well, creativity, may say the most technically)
	- Bjoern (no-brainer, I do lots of stuff, some overlap w/ Eric's, research projects)
	- Ken's (might also be generic, but he doesn't know technically about me much, just likes me/the work he thought I was doing) Eric will feel him out.
	- Eric (more weight on him to do technical side if pick Gail)
	- Due Nov 2
	- Approach them by ____ date
	- This is why it's good to do well in classes
	--> should send them the project I'm proposing (explain what I'm even doing, as soon as I have some idea). 
		- fun cool part that gets you exicted + computational part around it.
		- back up and add the computational part ("Why is this computer science")
		- progrmaming tool/environment, computational blah blah blah + creative side
		- also good w/: NSF wants to know impact
		"if this got funded, what new things might result." "there could be new interactive clothing industries" (economic perspective), health and well-being, education, broadening participation (womenzzzzz + intersectionality). Cool vision, + CS. Rethinking the practice of making/innovation. Designing actuated clothing.


--> ping 
- Due Oct 24 (for me)
