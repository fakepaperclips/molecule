#### What should we expect from research through design?
William Gaver. 2012. What should we expect from research through design?. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '12). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 937-946. DOI: has http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2207676.2208538

I assume this is one of those papers that got published partly because it generated a lot of debate!

The most compelling part of this paper for me was the various accounts of science. In particular, I think the details of how science actually works (from Feynman) as compared with the "legend" of how science works (also from Feynman) was a good reminder of the difference between the reality of how systems work on the ground with the mythologies told about this. Jonathan Grudin described this difference in his paper about Groupware: that large companies have their "mission statements" that may or may not reflect the way "work actually gets done." I particularly enjoyed this because my own experience in Academia has involved more squabbling over interpretation of data than I ever would have expected. While I deeply appreciate the discussion about how design is fundamentally different than science because the artifacts we create have an effect on the world, so it's never as clear-cut as just measuring things, I want to push back on Gaver's stated notion that the natural world is something external to us that simply gets described. For instance, there's the age-old question about whether mathematics was invented or discovered, and arguably it was invented since different mathematical formulations are internally consistent and describe the world just as well. In that sense I wonder if design need see itself as so entirely different from the scientific world at all...

I really resonate with the idea of generative design rather than convergence (but again, I don't see this as distinct from the way "real science" works: I just think it's a nice summary of that notion). 

Specifically this line: 
"From this point of view, the reason that research through design is not convergent is that it is a generative discipline, able to create multiple new worlds rather than describing a single existing one. " I guess I don't think that's particular to design! In fact, this is pretty much how I conceptualize all research: the ultimate goal of a researcher is to find a new field that generates a bunch of new questions, not simply "describe the world as it is." And one could argue that the act of framing questions itself has an effect on the world because it changes the way we perceive the world. 

In that sense I think I -- hilariously --  disagree with this paper *because* I fundamentally agree with everything it argues. (But I think it's arguing things about science that are based on a misunderstanding of how science works). 

#### Research through design as a method for interaction design research in HCI
John Zimmerman, Jodi Forlizzi, and Shelley Evenson. 2007. Research through design as a method for interaction design research in HCI. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '07). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 493-502. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1240624.1240704

I just need to get this off my chest: I hate the title of this paper. It sounds like a bot ingested a bunch of academic headlines and then auto-generated this nonsense. Researching design involves designing researchful design practices so that researchers -- and designers! -- can design (and research) their own research design methods. OMG. I've read it 8 billion times and my brain seg-faults halfway through every time.

Both this and the other paper celebrated the creation of artefacts. I thought the first paper provided a good argument for wy falsifiability isn't the right criteria, but I didn't feel like it provided new criteria to fill that vacuum. That's ok, though, because the second paper took a solid stab. Their list is: Process, Invention, Relevance, and Extensibility. I guess I'm still not sure how to use these to actually evaluate design research. It says "part of the judgement of the work examines the rigor applied to the methods and the rationale for the selection of specific methods". But...that's just stating something, it doesn't actually tell me how to evaluate the process or good methods. Or is this meant to be like the definition of art: you know it when you see it?

To sum up:
I really like both of these papers and I'm excited to discuss them but I didn't come away with strong conclusions from either of them! Good try, though, authors!

This paper is almost an internal discussion exposed as a paper. It's not about telling other fields they can't/don't participate in design, it's more about speaking to designers and emphasizing that their research methods are valuable, and constitute knowledge building.
Strong Concepts.
	- Ex: social navigation (anonymous rec systems, footprints in virtual/physical spaces, etc.)
Drift Table 
	- "Steve here has been living with this for about 2 weeks now, and we're going to ask him what he thinks it is"
	- Ambiguity and lack of control: user had to define for themselves what the interaction was, and what it meant.
	- Imagine a contextual inquiry that would result in this design: "Oh yes, we are floating over the countryside all the time but I'd really rather do it from the comfort of my living room, and I'd rather not be able to control where I'm going or what I see."
	- Users have to complete the narrative.
