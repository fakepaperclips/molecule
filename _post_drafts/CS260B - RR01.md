### Sketchpad response:

The first thing that strikes me about this paper is how closely it relates to the idea of Direct Manipulation - even though Schneiderman's paper on that subject wasn't published until nearly 20 years later! Specifically, choosing a graphical representation of data that is best shared visually is a perfect example of moving away from the "conversation metaphor" and towards the "model-world" metaphor described by Hutchins, et al. in their 1985 paper. 

I'm also drawn to the extraordinarily tangible interface Sutherland describes: zooming in by turning knobs, flipping switches to change functions: the whole system sounds as complicated as a pilot's cockpit (or the modern implementation of most CAD programs #burn #shade #iwentthere). Sutherland goes on to describe in great detail how one would construct a perfect hexagon or a perfect circle, and I'm very curious about how the average person in 1964 - who had never seen a computer, much less a graphical user interface like this one - would possibly interpret this. Would the system seem useful or just silly? Would it seem overly complicated? It's a reminder for myself to keep an open mind about how useful new interfaces may appear: and especially that we may not be able to predict the effect they'll have.

I'm also fascinated by the particular level of detail in the paper. It seems clear that the audience was expected to be those who had access to and familiarity with computers and compilers. Sutherland blithely references pointers with no explanation of what those are, apparently assuming that his audience needs no explanation.

I LOVE that the system basically teaches the user about one of its limitations by using that limitation as a control signal: the user indicates that they are finished drawing by flicking the pen too quickly for the system to track. I don't think it was intentionally done this way, but it provides the user with a mental model of how the system works, by revealing what might otherwise be considered a bug! Delicious.
