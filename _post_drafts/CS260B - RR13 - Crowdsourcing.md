#### Designing games with a purpose.
Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. 2008. Designing games with a purpose. Commun. ACM 51, 8 (August 2008), 58-67. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1378704.1378719

##### Response
I'm going to respond to both of these papers at once.

When I first read the title of the GWAP paper, I thought it was going to be about games that have more of a sense of purpose than "just" being fun (or supporting education). Like games that make you understand how "normal" people could have supported Nazis during WW2, or deeply question your life goals. Using human labor to benefit other, richer humans is cool, too, though, I guess.

Maintains existing power structures, offers no awareness of "invisible workers".
Actually that's something I want to address right away: I'm concerned about the lack of discussion around whose labor is being used here, and for whose benefit. Looking at the demographics of mechanical turk workers[1] (in 2010), mturkers in the U.S. are younger (median age 30 vs 36.6), educated (63% w/ college degrees vs 25%), and lower levels of annual income. (18% said the money they earn from mturk is "sometimes or always" necessary to make basic ends meet). This demographic survey didn't capture everything (Noticeably, why is racial information omitted? Also does everyone define "basic ends" the same?), but shining a light on "invisible workers"[2] is really important for the world to be the kind of world I want to live in, and I would press anyone doing crowdsourcing to strongly consider what kind of workers they are using, and who actually benefits from the completed tasks. In the case of GWAP, they didn't specify what types of projects were being created, but given the data they're collecting it's not clear who would benefit. In the case of Soylent, the kind of intellectual work being done by those using the Soylent system is not likely to directly benefit anyone for whom $20 a day is important for making "basic ends meet". This kind of work is also fairly highly skilled. Is this the best use of their time? It's like the opposite of Universal Basic Income: more boring and tedious tasks for a pittance (and forget job security or benefits).

In particular, the description of a "Lazy Turker" bothered me: why assume laziness? How about someone who really needs this money trying their best to quickly process these millions of tiny jobs in order to get enough food for the week? In light of those motivating factors, it seems callous to use the same language that is often used to deprive poor people of resources and support in politicla arguments. (I am sure it wasn't a maliciously chosen word, but this type of language defines and reveals our own beliefs around who deserves support in exchange for their labor).

Of course, I'm not saying that these works shouldn't have been done, or that all academic research needs to benefit all people all the time. Much of the time, it's not always clear how academic research will be successful at all! But it's worth being aware of the kinds of structural imbalances our research is not addressing, and may in fact be perpetuating.

Having said that....

##### Excellent writing and paper structure
Soylent is a classic in the field, apparently! I love the way they did their last paragraph: both effective and playful. I've never done work on Mechanical Turk, but if I ever did, I would immediately look at this paper first for ideas about how to use it. This might possibly be one of the most "immediately applicable" papers we've read in this class. It's also a really cool project, so nice work, authors! The relative ease and value in creating tasks for humans (natural language style) rather than machines (algorithmic) is an important shift.

GWAP is similarly well-structured. The way they embedded their tasks in the gameplay itself is compelling. This is the "good kind" of post-hoc rationalizing (well, it's not really post-hoc rationalizing of design guidelines, it's more a well-done abstracting of general principles, clearly communicated).

Infrastructure supports bite-size questions
One challenge for both of these, even with Soylent's more "human-friendly" question styles, is that this type of highly parallelizable work requires tasks that can be broken down into smaller chunks, and operationalized in this particular way. This does limit not only what work gets done, but the types of questions researchers can even hope to address using this type of crowd-work. These kinds of tasks are important, however, and the authors described them in ways that seem immediately helpful to anyone doing this kind of research.

##### Path to "real-world"
As with many of our projects, has this been made into a "real world" project? Is that even a worthy goal for academic research projects? I certainly imagine that Soylent helped other researchers doing work on crowdsourcing, paper editing, and a range of other fields. Same with GWAP: I'm sure it helped gather lots of data for a huge variety of researchers. But what is the role of academic research in the world of today? I mean, really? 

I commented above on the importance of a critical eye to systemic flaws in our societal infrastructure....but I would say none of my academic research to date has done anything to address those flaws. And if they had added a paragraph into their papers on it...would that do much? (I do think it's better than nothing, because it introduces the idea to folks who may not have heard of it before). But what is effective altruism, and what role can -- and SHOULD -- academic play in addressing these kinds of societal challenges?
