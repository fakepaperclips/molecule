#### Sotto voce: exploring the interplay of conversation and mobile audio spaces
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=503376.503454

What I learned from reading the Baudisch, et al., paper is that I privilege human-focused design contributions over technical contributions. In particular, I love the focus on creating a new type of interaction for museum-goers in this paper, rather than just a technical contribution. The focus on the experience is especially appealing to me. Having said that, I didn't find this particular study very compelling. I think mainly due to the fact that most of the users were either PARC employees, or friends/family of PARC employees. I am concerned that the findings didn't provide as much insight as they might have otherwise.

I also wonder if a similar design would have the same effect in 2017. Was the interaction partially created due to the novelty effect of the wirelessly-synched interface? I wonder if the idea would be as impactful now, and if not, whether any of the design considerations would translate to the current cultural environment.

Typically with interactive devices like this, privacy is a major concern. But due to the limited scope of interactions, that didn't come up as much with this project. This reminds me of Hydrosense: it seems most applicable and useful in cases where the environment is constrained in a way that makes any privacy concerns less...concerning. I feel like many interaction papers try to be the end-all, be-all of devices that will apply to everyone in every situation, but to enable a particular interaction in a particular setting not only seems like a better scope for a paper, but seems like it might actually be implemented "in the real world".

Speaking of "implementations in the real world", I have noticed that I tend to judge the success of papers by whether or not any one 'really' uses them. Even while I can appreciate the novelty and challenge involved in a solution such as the Baudisch et al., work, I still find myself dismissing the work if it doesn't seem to have had much of an impact on actual products with which I amm familiar. Yet, is this the purpose of research? Is it always meant to lead to productization? How best should we judge the "success" of a paper: novelty also doesn't seem like the best assessment...I find myself more drawn to work that does have some kind of impact on...something - whether it's opening up a new field, suggesting a novel methodology that people may use, or sharing a new data-set or design guidelines, I highly value work that can be more-or-less immediately applied to new research.

- Human-centered design
- Using technology for cool stuff
- Would this have the same effect in 2017, w/ our more tech-savvy audiences?
- privacy concerns limited due to nature of interaction location (similar to a use for Hydrosense: makes sense in certain limited situations)
- Favorite sentence: "mutual eavesdropping mode created an ongoing assumption that the
couple would continue in shared activity rather than disengaging
and pursuing independent activity."
- limited users, wanted more!

#### General
- tendency to judge/assess success by # of successful applications, real-world deployments, etc. Is that the right thing? What is the purpose of research?
