#### Agenda

- AR stuff update
  - Ideas
    - Video as input: What about "movement" as input? Could you extract "something" from a video of something moving? Like style transfer for videos I guess? Or like Kimiko's ["I/O Brush"](http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/io-brush/) but for AR.
    - Body movement as input: Kinesthetic learning, but for actuated AR systems (broad definition of actuated); on-body sensors; "arbitrary" mapping from body movement to whatever actuation - individual for each actuator.
  - Related work
    - Vision-based hand-tracking.
      - Best: Gloves.
      - Very challenging problem for CV: 1) self-occlusions, 2) processing speed (but in 2007...different now?), 3)

    - Focus on input w/ custom set of vibration sensors worn in armband

    - More input, depth-sensor this time.

    - [Code repos w/ citations](https://github.com/xinghaochen/awesome-hand-pose-estimation). And another [link](https://github.com/xinghaochen/awesome-hand-pose-estimation). [Implementation](https://github.com/lzddzh/HandPoseEstimation) w/ single-depth image from Chi Xu's paper.  [Implementation](https://github.com/hjurong/hand-pose-estimation) from Qian et al.,'s paper.
    - Another paper on "existing challenges", but from 2007 again. [Link.] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3421786_Gesture_Recognition_A_Survey) 
    
- Passive On-Body Wearables update
  - Everyone does not seem to be on-board (meeting next week to clarify).
  
**Lower priority**
- Undergrad 2-second check-in
- [Petition to count CS294-133 "Collaborative Intelligent Agents" as a Systems breadth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VgmwqgFxMfP3Qa-Yd5p0-WZMb8C2ygms/view)
