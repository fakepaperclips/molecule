may need to trim intro 
get faster to what I'm doing / did (haha)

abstract needs to move lower

what eric thinks I'm doing:
wanna look at how people use snapchat/faceapp w/ focus on how they use AR (but doesn't relate to clothing).

current plan might not be enough stuff
meet in middle w/ other plan?
don't want to get scooped w/ AR tool for interactive stuff

could see:
look at snapchat, way of body personalization, performative/public/private, 
don't try to bite off whole research territory (hahaha)
how do people now, if they're making own clothes or modifying clothes, how can they experiment with / envision these interactions.
Could say: let's look at how digital AR / snapchat
how, why, who do you share these things with, do you feel like you're performing?
people understand the digital representation and they know they don't actually look like that. Would they want to? Why do people use these digital overlays/digital cosmetics

3 envisioned ways to do x:
- video mockups, sketches, etc.
(but that doesn't seem like enough)

Do study re: snapchat, people talk about it
Informed by that, we envision some set of AR-inspired design tools for this new fashion prototyping new interactive / gestural textiles fashion world situation.
magic mirror
this type of work has been done before, ex: 
- look at ways people made on thingiverse, here's how we imagine how a tool would work that would collage them.

motivate need further (no tool that does interactive exploration of these gestural textiles, coupled w/ and they're definitely coming, but there are no design tools to support this).
storyboard effects too (collar to do this, ripple to do that).
Might get something from user study (performance mode, but more interested in subtle things that "normal" people might be interested in) (jacquard ebb was good on this front)

could motivate where research needs to go
- do we need more accurate clothing / textile physics models?
- need more lighting properties?

cool story w/ help you get dressed story.
- some market will emerge and people will start to use that
- all static cloting that traditionally people wake up, make that decision, and live w/ it all day. How will that relationship change if it moves
- how about a tool that lets people or designers that tries to explore that.

paper could read:
- different kidns of radical wearables / clothing will change
- no tools to support that
- tools to support single event clothing opportunities
- but as designers there needs to be this kind of dynamic support tool
- closest thing is snapchat

focus:
materiality
interactivity
wearables

online discussions of body and identity as one motivation
interactive body-based tool (snapchat) coupled w/ interviews
argue that this informs 3 possible visions (magic mirror, X, Y)
new metaphors instead of the mirror
subscribe to the trends, feel like a pinterest thing where you get alerts and you can try new stuff on your shirt in AR.
real-live keyframing

further clarify self-acknowledgement (which of the 4 authors does this refer to?)

current framing:
people who are engaging w/ diff gender identities, how do they play w/ snapchat, online communities
people who don't identify with that won't see any use for it
extra burden: if we learn x, y, and z there's a strong rationale for why someone that doesn't identify w that group.
normal person desires: eric wants his shirt flaps to do some crazy thing. The mechanism should feel like "oh that's the same as tying my shoelaces", make it not seem "othering". Should feel exciting and encouraging interactive textiles/clothing.

args in the front point to important motivation that isn't normally talked about. then it seems like it's only for them.
start w/ more mundane
- allow different air flow, jacquard, on-body robots, etc.

other stuff is stronger/cooler vision. Let people play with gender etc. Right now that overpowers the other args.
tie in cosplay, fandoms, every day costume choices, LARPing, how would they prototype these kinds of costumes. This could be a bridge. Look at performers/LARPers/cosplayers, how do they interate w/ interactive things, then look at mundane, how do people develop these in a commercial setting.

moments of goodness:
cool research dump of things I find exciting.
good passion,

gut: don't use enough of active voice (passive voice good for argumentation)
Instead of saying "we can implement these new ideas with AR" : "we implemented these ideas in AR" or "these ideas were implemented in AR"

"this will not only serve existing communities" that line is ok
abstract is motivation (more passive)
then what you did, active
then end w/ a high note

headings
- intro
- assessment of existing applications
- here's money: list of 3 things

here's what stops me from going deeper
- layered in with good prose (but people can't handle prose)
- intro should end w/ a paragraph that tells me the shit that I did
- simple as joining the lsat three.
- start the paragraph w/ "now I'm going to tell you what I did in tihs paper"
- clarify intent of the paragarph in the first sentence
- "cltohign can affec" should be high-level problem statement
- "however" this is how I looked at this design space (or it should be)
- "consider the way Doran" - this language won't hold up at DIS
- humanistic writing such as above, is more plural, you make it clear that you are subjective and there are multiple interpretations. Saw this especially in the kiln gods dissertation where she said she's writing w/ I as her own POV.
- reader just wants to know the way to interpret it. esp in cases of gender id and embodiment, a note worthy characteristics is that it's delineated as inside the body, outside the body, across the body, then details about what those mean, then end of paragraph. step further to condense it down.
- There are the following frameworks in place. 
- cesar is then expecting that roadmap: 1. gender id theroeis specifically applied to wearables as opposed to heftier term. there, cover different theories and frameworks. Don't try to condense a theory into one word, but be a little more free-form. The following resources specifically detail this theory in detail. Here's how it's applied in this context. 2. then examples of this subversion. from tumblr other online communities. shouldn't be me explaining it to them. Me giving people a feel for the design space. Ex: one way we can decompose this space is by work that involves the virtual body, physical body, and some other distinction. For example, fulenito creates this mythical hashtag that surfaces these. Related work is walking you through that space w/o overwhelming. 3-prong space, how do you dance in that space. Define the boundaries.
- too many examples (performance, doctor's lab coat) in last paragraph on first page.
- should have a record/archive of what I'm looking at, so sources that provide that are good.
- then remind reader what we talked about w/ the different principles. not just one body, virtual/physical, cyborg, monstrous feminine, trans people are these early adopters of the cyborg.
- end of abstract: expecting techno contribution.
- cesar's fave design papers:

"biggest mistake people make w/ user studiess: people just report what occurred. User 2 said this, user 4 said this. Whereas a good analysis would come up w some higher level synthesis. It's clear they did the user study 3 days before the deadline and there is no high level synthesis. This is good from a review standpoint, because it's an easy way to give a paper a low rating."

what 'counts' as high-level synthesis? "maybe you can go from weak theory to strong theory where you not only make.....the reason I'm cautious about [sarah's example] is when you condition things "only in these circumstances/these people". I see why you're doing it, bc you don't want to be technodeterministic 'oh tech will solve all these problems'. I'd need to see it written out to really tell you."

anther example: people talked about how they conceptualized style. everyone has sa gut feeling but difficulty expressing it. here are some quotes, people were talking about it in a new day at the end of the study. "wow what an interesting obvservation, people have intuition on style. So, how can you give some new insight on it."

"main allergies, these are antihistamines of these allergiess...in the end all these tech tools dont' capture teh info they want, it's very digital (or whatever), 2-3 tech allergies. so if I were to design a tool outside of CW I would look at those allergens. you want to be able to generalize/impact a larger field. Drawing out a concept. It's way too easy to go in there and see everything specific to creative writing or fan fictions. so now I think this only applies to essays, I don't see it applying to visual work."

does it feel like you're overreaching? "absolutely. that's why you try to support it. Something we got very good feedback on was defamiliarization, bc it's a moment for people eto be more creative. We linked it to this paper that looked at defamiliarization. hey, someone has been talking about defamiliarization and we saw it in our study. So I'm sure there are papers on intuition, but they try to draw out different types of intuition. So then you can say this fits under this type of intuition, but there's potential to explore differenet types of intuition. Social vs individual intuition."

"can someone who is not doing CW visualization extract meaningful info"
