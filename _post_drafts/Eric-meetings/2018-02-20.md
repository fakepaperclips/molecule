### Agenda
- Passive On-Body Wearable Computers.
  - Meeting scheduled.
  - What's the value beyond "AlterWear next step"?


### Notes

Stage-play perf.
  - Location-based ideas:.
  - Tracking audience: audience moving in/out of regions trigger actions.
    - num of people in an area, num people moving through an area, rate of change, num of people returning,
    - Slightly less obvious: Can we use this to recreate how someone makes a decision? "Returning to change your mind" or to reward "getting more info". **Trajectory** thinking, w/ regard to life-time growth/learning, recreated in stage experience.
    - Outside of perf now: Hypercustomize information sharing: something knows when you have returned, and how long ago you returned, and what you learned.
  - Displaying side
    - Viz of "where you've been" in the show, ability to do speed-run, change the order, personalize an experience and have it visualized.
  - Tracking performers
    - Performers can automatically trigger sound cues, or lighting cues by moving into a zone.
    - A performer knows their heart rate will trigger a drumb sound in the music, but only if they're in a certain part of the room - they can consciously choose to go there.
    - The stage as an interactive entity.
    - Location as material on the stage.
    - Not sure this would look any different from the audience's point of view.
  - Tracking audience: audience in different regions of the theatre.
    - Would be cool if this could change some part of the show they experienced: AR goggles maybe.
  - Sensor-reading-based ideas:
    - Spatialized rituals - meditation spot. A new take on "biometric tracking" - only happens with a conscious choice to enter a particular area.
    - CogSci stuff re: location-based thought/reasoning?
    
Transition to high-level framings.
  - Location-based biometrics.
