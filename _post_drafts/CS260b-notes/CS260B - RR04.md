#### HydroSense: Infrastructure-Mediated Single-Point Sensing of Whole-Home Water Activity 
Froehlich, Jon E., et al. "HydroSense: infrastructure-mediated single-point sensing of whole-home water activity." Proceedings of the 11th international conference on Ubiquitous computing. ACM, 2009.

- leveraging invisible infrastructure in an interesting new way
- focus on ease of installation
- interface /w messy infrastructure to realize goal of ubicomp
- has this been installed/developed anywhere? products?
- was one of the authors a plumber?
- detailed description of challenges related to capturing, cleaning, smoothing data
- how did they verify their technique for identifying signal moments?
- difficulty in analyzing multi-homes connected to a single line. futuristic homes? assume western-style single-family/system home structures?
- calling out Fogerty by name as this system being better.

#### The Mobile Sensing Platform: An Embedded Activity Recognition System


- Using MSP to provide ground-truth for another study. This seems like a great use.
