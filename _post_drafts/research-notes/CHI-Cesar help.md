1. Footage on the new thing of a stepper motor going 
Moves up and down, cut to arduino, type something in, it does something different
Slap dragon teeth on it, program a dragon's mouth to open/close
Point: motors a: difficult to program, tedious, compile cycle, 
b: it's all about context, what you put it on that determines how things should be programmed

Then: 2 stepper motors, and 2 dragons talking to each other, design behaviors to be speech so they can talk to each other, gets at interleaving commands (programming that by hand would be nightmare)
2d dragon cut-out.

Baby 
Shots of stepper motors moving, to get that footage

- difficulty of thinking about code brings focus to 

Video montage
- stepper motors
- compile/run cycle that is long
- go to this angle. The tool could say (both go to 180, 90, etc), tool also does timing, and tool tells you if you go to an impossible angle. 
- "...90 iterations later" or maybe a time-analysis. Amt of time spent compiling. Histogram/bar chart w/ time spent coding/compiling.
- focus on rx/tx uploading step ()

simple motions are possible, snippet of the code which is simple.
(color overlay to highlight)
rarely more complicated than this, due to histogram/time spent compiling/coding.
*real session* of christie programming motion on a built artifact.
8~`8**~~* design tool transition **~*~*~8`8`8`8`8
no compile time, much more complex movement.

Dragon
- lasercut cardboard, vinyl on the cardboard to pop it out.

"I got it" - Cesar:
have dragon mouth and someone is puppeting it to show what they want.
- difficult to convert to code. 
- would have been a good user study to have people try to replicate some complex puppetted movement in code / with design tool.

screen one: what you want to happen
screen two: what actually happens w/ compile time
interleaving commands

Build a dragon w/ top and bottom jaws that need to move simultaneously.



2. 6 cardboard-to-relay connections
was doing w/ magnets one on the bottom one on the top.
