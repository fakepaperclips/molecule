may need to trim intro 
get faster to what I'm doing / did (haha)

abstract needs to move lower

what eric thinks I'm doing:
wanna look at how people use snapchat/faceapp w/ focus on how they use AR (but doesn't relate to clothing).

current plan might not be enough stuff
meet in middle w/ other plan?
don't want to get scooped w/ AR tool for interactive stuff

could see:
look at snapchat, way of body personalization, performative/public/private, 
don't try to bite off whole research territory (hahaha)
how do people now, if they're making own clothes or modifying clothes, how can they experiment with / envision these interactions.
Could say: let's look at how digital AR / snapchat
how, why, who do you share these things with, do you feel like you're performing?
people understand the digital representation and they know they don't actually look like that. Would they want to? Why do people use these digital overlays/digital cosmetics

3 envisioned ways to do x:
- video mockups, sketches, etc.
(but that doesn't seem like enough)

Do study re: snapchat, people talk about it
Informed by that, we envision some set of AR-inspired design tools for this new fashion prototyping new interactive / gestural textiles fashion world situation.
magic mirror
this type of work has been done before, ex: 
- look at ways people made on thingiverse, here's how we imagine how a tool would work that would collage them.

motivate need further (no tool that does interactive exploration of these gestural textiles, coupled w/ and they're definitely coming, but there are no design tools to support this).
storyboard effects too (collar to do this, ripple to do that).
Might get something from user study (performance mode, but more interested in subtle things that "normal" people might be interested in) (jacquard ebb was good on this front)

could motivate where research needs to go
- do we need more accurate clothing / textile physics models?
- need more lighting properties?

cool story w/ help you get dressed story.
- some market will emerge and people will start to use that
- all static cloting that traditionally people wake up, make that decision, and live w/ it all day. How will that relationship change if it moves
- how about a tool that lets people or designers that tries to explore that.

paper could read:
- different kidns of radical wearables / clothing will change
- no tools to support that
- tools to support single event clothing opportunities
- but as designers there needs to be this kind of dynamic support tool
- closest thing is snapchat

focus:
materiality
interactivity
wearables

online discussions of body and identity as one motivation
interactive body-based tool (snapchat) coupled w/ interviews
argue that this informs 3 possible visions (magic mirror, X, Y)
new metaphors instead of the mirror
subscribe to the trends, feel like a pinterest thing where you get alerts and you can try new stuff on your shirt in AR.
real-live keyframing

further clarify self-acknowledgement (which of the 4 authors does this refer to?)

current framing:
people who are engaging w/ diff gender identities, how do they play w/ snapchat, online communities
people who don't identify with that won't see any use for it
extra burden: if we learn x, y, and z there's a strong rationale for why someone that doesn't identify w that group.
normal person desires: eric wants his shirt flaps to do some crazy thing. The mechanism should feel like "oh that's the same as tying my shoelaces", make it not seem "othering". Should feel exciting and encouraging interactive textiles/clothing.

args in the front point to important motivation that isn't normally talked about. then it seems like it's only for them.
start w/ more mundane
- allow different air flow, jacquard, on-body robots, etc.

other stuff is stronger/cooler vision. Let people play with gender etc. Right now that overpowers the other args.
tie in cosplay, fandoms, every day costume choices, LARPing, how would they prototype these kinds of costumes. This could be a bridge. Look at performers/LARPers/cosplayers, how do they interate w/ interactive things, then look at mundane, how do people develop these in a commercial setting.

moments of goodness:
cool research dump of things I find exciting.
good passion,
