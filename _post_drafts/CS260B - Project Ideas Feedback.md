Idea 1 = [4]

This idea is nice because much of are automated technologies have removed this altruistic exposure.  I'll give you a simple personal example.  When you used to drive across the Bay Bridge and have to pay the toll in cash you would often get to the toll booth and the person would say, "hey the previous driver paid for you"  It was such a wonderful experience and yet anonymous as you would often not be able to quickly catch up to them as they vanished into the sea of cars ahead.  However Fastpass now automates are toll collection and avoid stopping and searching for exact change, etc.  But it eliminated this wonderful social experience.  The area and technique you porpoise could yield nice design insights into how to easily embed such experience back into automated designs without going back to ... well searching for loose change in your car to return to the previous example.


Idea 2  = [5]

Fantastic idea.  This is really powerful, provocative, and promotes ethical and moral debates about the appropriate usage of technologies.  Great project idea.


Idea 3 = [3]

Understanding the quality o data is a real and significant issue.  I'm not sure the proposed technique you have here makes the best sense.  It feels overly complex and broad and vague on the types of data it addresses. You have several other strong project ideas, in my opinion, to choose from.


Idea 4 = [4]

Clean and well-defined concept.  This could work quite well in helping people understand the flow of tax dollars.  It may also be a nice way to understand even more strongly how it connects to voting.  For example, listing the city council members that voted for various roads, parks, etc.  Could be a powerful civic tool.  I like the potential impact for this idea.

Idea 5 = [4]

This is exactly aligned with the effort as part of the Inclusive AI (as part of CITRIS COnnected Communities): 

http://citris-uc.org/connected-communities/project/inclusive-ai-technology-policy-diverse-urban-future/

You could really make an impact here if you could help prevent concepots, ideas, and frameworks for people to understand these ethical issues with AI.  You are not going to solve this but start the conversation which is key.  Nice idea

Idea 6 = [2]

I understand where the motivation is coming from but it feels like there needs to be a pre-interview/study to understand what the concerns are for hospitalized people.   My feeling is being connected with loved ones is more important than trying to keep a virtual plant alive.

Idea 7 = [4]

I've seen others work on this idea of a more personalized on-demand therapist and it is very likely coming to our devices soon.  It would be hard to do a full study in the time period for this class but you could likely assemble a real-time system.  It would also be interesting to attach it to a speech to text system so you can more naturally interact with it.  

Idea 8 = [4]

This feel missing from our digital tools which are always about the hear and now.  When you look at an old newspaper it has added from the time which are visual cues to the time period and context.  When we read an article online from a year ago it still has current events flashing adjacent to it.  What you propose is a nice simple but likely effective technique to place that in context.  This is very feasible and seems like it would have a nice effect.

Idea 9 = [2]

I'm always dubious of computers beginning in via automated artistic interpretations.  I realize this could be part of a larger "which one doesn't belong" AR tools which is a bit more interesting but I am at least somewhat hopeful that we as people drive that discussion rather than always prompted or relying on computers to handle that task for us.


Idea 10 = [2]

I understand the idea and approach but trusting such algorithms might not be entirely based on the people using them.  Some of these algorithms are appropriate for some applications and not for others so just knowing that I have used it without modification many times doesn't mean it is right or should be equally trusted by you.
