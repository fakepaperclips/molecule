## Adriana Schulz

- Her strengths and preferences (1:1) didn't match w/ Berkeley, so her proposed course design (which sounds GREAT) doesn't necessarily fit w/ the realities of classes at Berkeley. This was a tripping moment. "That's something I'd have to think about and work on." - she didn't seem prepared.
- Tendency to ramble (as I do).
- Stories can be good, but back them up with specific answers.

## General Thoughts
- Don't get overly focused on a single question or question-asker (aka model the type of classroom you'd actually want to run). Plus: people can get pulled into weird convos w/ a specific person, and other folks in the group may not want to interrupt so you're trapped). 

## Questions
- High-level 30-sec introduction of your research.
- Specific goals/plans/philosophies/actions to support mental health for the students / lab / culture / community (aka hot-button issues of the day).
- Mentoring style + teaching philosophy (aka things that will affect this audience).
- How would you increase under-representative minorities in programs on campus. (another hot-button issue).
