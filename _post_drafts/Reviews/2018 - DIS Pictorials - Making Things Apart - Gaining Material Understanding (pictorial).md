## Checklist for reviewers
Does the Pictorial:

- Take advantage of an image-based format, or would a text-based format be better suited to the Pictorial?
- Does the Pictorial make a contribution to HCI (and beyond)?
- Does it make a clear, logical argument that makes the claim of the paper believable?
- Represent a visual quality high enough to convey the message of the Pictorial?
= Do you think it turns into a visually engaging presentation? What would this format be?

## The detailed review
Write your review of the pictorial here. Please identify positive and negatives of the work and the pictorial, plus any suggestions for revisions.

The authors designed a workshop based on the "Uncrafting" framework, and here report the outcome of several workshops. The authors identify 9 categories of material resources and knowledge and report these in pictorial format.

The authors successfully ran several workshops, and collected many photographs. The images on Page3 and Page8 clearly communicate the different materialities identified by the authors. The core idea is interesting, and worthwhile to the DIS community (and beyond), but is not currently well-communicated. The authors say this paper "describes a set of exercises", but the focus of the paper seems to be more about the types of materialities that resulted from their workshops rather than the exercises themselves. The exercises are briefly mentioned, but without the amount of detail a workshop-organizer might hope for. Rather, the majority of the paper is taken up with images of the nine categories of materiality.

It's unclear on whether the 4 stages (Material Inquiry, Material Exploration, Material Exposition, and Material Inspiration) are new, or are these from Uncrafting? P3 is especially confusing. What is the relationship between reference 9 and this paper? What part of the "unmaking" framework comes from prior work, and what is new?

The paper does not spend enough time describing the value of their new framework. In particular, the paper is unclear on the difference between "material literacy in education" and "a practice of engaging with technology that unfolds particular material resources". Expanding on this distinction is necessary to understand the contribution. A pictorial can still have a great deal of explanatory text, and more text here would increase the explanatory power of this work.

To sum up, changes I would like to see:
- Clarify contribution (materialities vs exercises, if exercises please describe in more detail), especially what comes from reference #9, and expand on framework explanations.
- Remove unhelpful images, rework whitespace to more efficiently use space, and update diagram and color choices to be more helpful.

### Typos
- typos / problems with english. Unclear phrasings (hebocon contestant: make it more clear this is a robot, since a "contestant" usually refers to a person).
- Typo/missing info: pg. 6 "The hebocon battlefield and audience during festival XX" should prob specify what XX stands for.
- Workshop 4: what is an "architecture"?
- Typo, pg. 8 in heading "Material Ressources" 
- Instead of drawing a counter-clockwise arrow, why not arrange the pictures in a more reasonable way?

## Comments on the pictorial qualities
Please describe how this Pictorial leverages the pictorial format. For instance: How critical are the visual elements to the authors contribution? Does the Pictorial lend itself to a compelling visual presentation? Does this Pictorial present something unique from what can be presented in another format? [200 words max]

The subject may indeed be a good fit for a Pictorial presentation, since images would capture the materialities better than words ever could. In particular, the images on Page3 and Page8 clearly communicate the different materialities identified by the authors. However, five of the included images are variations of a single diagram that is not a particularly good use of space, and does not make good use of color.  Overall, the images did not always support the paper. In particular, many of the images were repetitive group shots of people working, in ways that did not provide extra information or support insightful analysis. For example, in the section about "Performance as Material", the first and second images in the row along the bottom seem nearly identical, and the entire row does not tell a compelling story. The very first image in hte paper (Page 2) is completely unclear: the very shallow depth of focus and lacking context makes it very difficult to see what the image is.
