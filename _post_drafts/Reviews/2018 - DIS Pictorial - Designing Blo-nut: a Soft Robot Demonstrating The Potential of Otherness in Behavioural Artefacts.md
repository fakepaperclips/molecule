### Write your review of the pictorial here. Please identify positive and negatives of the work and the pictorial, plus any suggestions for revisions.
May I humbly suggest a new name? Blo-nut has some unfortunate connotations for North American speakers of English. (Specifically referencing a sex act and genitalia). Lat-sac also sounds extremely unfortunate. Connotations: vulgar, sexual, medical, genitalia, alien, bodily function.  I leave the authors to decide if that's what they want their audience to come away with.

**Positive**
- Explanation of software choice very well motivated and interesting!
- GORGEOUS images and diagrams: clear, helpful, interesting shots, beautiful use of color, just really gorgoues.
- Pg. 9 - BEAUTIFUL setup image. vvery pretty, with great information about the setup while also clearly conveying how it worked

**Negative**
- teeny: can the grey background be a little darker? For instance on Pg. 9 it's a little hard to read the light text on the lightish gray background.
- pg. 10, 11: pink text is hard to read. Re-format, and change color. Overlapping with images is VERY hard to read.
- VERY picky, but the shadows in hte image on page 7 are slightly distracting. Only because the rest of your images are so unbelievably gorgeous! Not necessary to fix, just would be nice. May I also suggest renumbering those? I believe it's more intuitive to go 1, 2, 3, 4" from left to right, then down to the next row, and then "5, 6, 7, 8". (You don't have to take a new picture for this, just renumber).
- Pg. 7 is talking about "dissolvable" stuff, which feels a bit like it comes out of nowhere. Image 5 talks about the "halfway" stage: halfway between what and what? Additional context about this earlier would be nice.
- Pg. 8 - I'm confused about image 8. Suddenly an actuation description? Can you make this more clear?
- I remain unconvinced that "Blo-nuts" design is not zoomorphic. Specifically sea anemones come to mind. In future work, I'd love to see more of a discussion about what types of designed interfaces count as "other", and what actually provokes feelings of / understandings of "otherness" in an audience.

**Typos**
- pg 7: disovled
- pg 7: ‘sinuey’ -> "sinewy"
- pg 12: "Presented alongside Blonut, This" --> lowercase T.


### Please describe how this Pictorial leverages the pictorial format. For instance: How critical are the visual elements to the authors contribution? Does the Pictorial lend itself to a compelling visual presentation? Does this Pictorial present something unique from what can be presented in another format? [200 words max]
YES - beautiful. They clearly convey the interactions, and especially the capabilities of the two soft robots, as well as the designed interface very well.
