### Write your review of the pictorial here. Please identify positive and negatives of the work and the pictorial, plus any suggestions for revisions.
In this pictorial, the authors share the design process of an inflatable, soft robot. Detailed and beautiful images clearly depict the designs and some interactions with the robot, as well as the "choreographic sketching" tool they used.

Overall this is a well-done pictorial, with useful and interesting images. The explanation of the software choice is very well-motivated and well-written. The images and diagrames are clear, helpful, interesting angles, have beautiful use of color, and communicate the necessary information very well. In particular, Pg. 9's image has an interesting setup, that conveys exactly the necessary information about how it worked while also being very cool to look at. Overall the images are great quality. The choice of shape seems well-motivated and well-described (though on Pg. 5, this sentence seems to have a missing word: " Blo-nut was chosen to have three to
avoid comparison to..." chosen to have three what?).

A few nitpicky suggestions that would nevertheless improve the paper:
- Darken the grey background. For instance on Pg. 9 it's difficult to read the light text on the lightish gray background.
- Change pink text color and fix formatting. On pg. 10, 11: pink text is hard to read. Re-format, and change color. Overlapping with images is VERY hard to read.
- If possible, retake the image on page 7. The shadows detract from the information. The editing is also unfortunate but understandable if necessary.
- Renumber the images on Pg. 7. It's more common to go "1, 2, 3, 4" from left to right across the top, then down to the next row, and then continue "5, 6, 7, 8". Note that you do not have to retake the picture for this, just renumber.
- Additional context needed. Pg. 7 suddenly starts talking about "dissolvable" material, which comes out of nowhere. Image 5 talks about the "halfway" stage: halfway between what and what? Add additional context about this earlier.
- Additional context needed. Pg. 7 - image 8 is labeled in a completely different format than the rest. It is suddenly an actuation description. Can you make this more clear? 
- I remain unconvinced that the "Blo-nut" design is not zoomorphic. Specifically, sea anemones immediately come to mind. 

May I strongly suggest a new name? Blo-nut has some unfortunate connotations for North American speakers of English. (Specifically referencing a sex act and genitalia). It is vulgar, and borderline inappropriate. Lat-sac also has similar connotations: medical, genitalia, alien, bodily functions (but at least lat-sac doesn't directly reference a sex act). 

**Typos**
- pg 7: disovled
- pg 7: ‘sinuey’ -> "sinewy"
- pg 12: "Presented alongside Blonut, This" --> lowercase T.


### Please describe how this Pictorial leverages the pictorial format. For instance: How critical are the visual elements to the authors contribution? Does the Pictorial lend itself to a compelling visual presentation? Does this Pictorial present something unique from what can be presented in another format? [200 words max]
YES - beautiful. The images clearly convey the interactions, and especially the capabilities of the two soft robots, as well as the designed interface very well. The design process is communicated well, though more detail would better support future authors in recreating or building upon this work.
