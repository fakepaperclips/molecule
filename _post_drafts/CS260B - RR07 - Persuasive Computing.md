"when formal regulatory controls are strong, individuals come to belieev that, if it is necessary to invoke stringent regulations, those regulations must exist in oposition to the preferences that "people like me" hold."
--> "outrage" theatre, and tendency to push back when someone calls you racist.

Injunctive social norm, descriptive social norm (Grudin's "how groups actually work")
This is also why scholars who study authoritarian regimes warn against normalization of behavior. Why T is so dangerous.

LOVE THIS:
"What's surprising, given the ubiquity and strength of the evidence, is how little note people take of this potent form of influence at two crucial compliance-relevant decision points: (1) when, as observers, they decide how to interpret the causes of their own actions; and (20 when, as tacticians, they decide how to influence the actions of others."
--> a flipping on the head, this stood out to me as a fascinating twist. Trying to articulate why....maybe because it's about action.

How did they measure theft rates of the wood? Did they perform full-body searches of visitors? (Also how did they avoid bias for this part).

AMAZING opening quote

"Physical cues" like having eyes, mouth, etc.? What about mimicking, eye contact, etc....seems more interesting.

"deliberately designing psychological cues is unethical and unhelpful." So we should do it not-deliberatley, then? People do this whether or not we want them to.

Example of Iwin.com: ugh are we supposed to do this? It's horrible. Confused about the recommendation here.

"Language is never neutral"

This kind of happy/goofy language can sooo easily backfire, though.

Great description of confounds in reciprocity study.

Problems: so creating an agent in the form of a "helpful assistant" is persuasive, but then people just design female-signalled behaviors. DiskDoctor vs Teacher for Mavis Teaches Typing. reinforcing these kinds of social roles / expectations.

"When is it not appropriate to enhance social cues? When the sole purpose of teh technology product is to improve efficiency", then gives example of not itneracting w/ gas station attendant. But so much tech now is allll about "efficiency" - it's not clear when that should apply and when it shouldn't. Bodega example. People can use anything to perform a task.
