### Accessibility
Sato et al. come across as thrilled and justifiably excited to share the swept frequency capacitive sensing technique, based on their repeated statements that they "are not aware of any previous attempt" to apply the technique to touch interactions. I've read this paper before, and the applications enabled by such a technology are basically a dream come true for any HCI researcher: single wire, wide variety of touches sensed, and huge range of potential topologies. As in Han's paper, the authors go into a great deal of detail about how capacitive touch sensing actually works, describing the way AC signals interact with the human body in depth. Han also spends time describing how the mechancis of frustrated total internal reflection work. Having read many papers that simply redirect the reader to a 200-page thesis rather than describe the concepts behind the technology, I deeply appreciate this move towards accessibility. 

However, I have actually tried to implement a version of Touche for a research project, and the only reason we succeeded was because someone else had created an open-source Arduino-based version of the system. Indeed, as I've tried to replicate and expand on the work of many people, I have routinely found that there are never enough details to succeed as quickly and easily as I'd like. Not only is this frustrating, but I strongly feel that this type of "halfway there" documentation actively undermines the research community. Rather than standing on the shoulders of these researchers, I find myself nipping at their heels. I yearn for the day when everyone releases their code with research-friendly licenses, provides the files needed to create the hardware (rather than stylized drawings in the paper), and even creates Instructable-like documentation to walk someone through a Hello World-type basic functionality.

### Tangible interfaces
It's also fascinating to me how both of these interfaces enable touch interactions. While it's true that the Han paper is described as being a screen,
