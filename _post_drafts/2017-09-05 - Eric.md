##### Research
Designerly - send to DIS, cool visuals, performance
Nice to have it more polished, etc.

##### NSF
Figure out who can write rec letters. --> (ping eric about this in a week)
prestige and flexibility.
Write 2 pages
It has to feel like
Look at Christie's and Cesar's NSF things (they both got them)
	- Christie's had something related to cosmetic computing, very different than where her projects ended up but still related.
Proposing to do research project that is a big enough chunk that is
- interesting
- something to show, some preliminary results. The ones that work well have a story that's some larg-ish problem, open-ended.
- early results, some initial thing.
- generate a plan for tackling it.
- I have some expertise
- good if it's tied to a larger problem / humanitarian story.
- can put ~4 core references, (strategic: good AI, good CS, whatever)
- decide w/ Eric what that is
	- maybe the wearables? (eric said he's biased)
	- need to tie to a real problem
	- empowering a community that doesn't participate, e.g., citizen science
	- health and well-being aspect
	- include the hair a bit, if it fits.
	- repositioning biosensors
	- something something prosthetics
	- hospital clowning (other uses for spectacular wearable)
	- reminders
	--> spend time thinking about real problems
	- in some part of this is this expressivity, and sensor-positioning story, but also new kinds of haptics, new feelings. Could have something about how all our input is vibration what if we could do more. Cloting could produce things for reminders/gaming exp/AR/VR/new communication/audience participation stuff/etc.
	- Maybe ask Tomas about this? Maybe touch base with him.
What they're looking for:
	- is this a CS thing
	- only 2 pages, can be higher risk
	- ML to drive these systems
	- don't want a fancy arts and crafts projects.
	- someone would read it and think "oh yeah we should definitely work on that"
	- I've thought really hard about this
	- I have some early insights (I've done x, y, and z, can list hair as under submission)
	- introduce a vision for something worth working on
	- indicators it's a good direction
	- rough plan w/ a reasonable timeframe --> talk w/ Eric about this
	- ends w/ here's how I think the world would change if you fund this and everything happens (big picture things).
Have to be cautious about somethings
	- Anything they fund becomes a public document.
	- Congressional members will try to pick on you for weird phrasings and so on.


##### GSI ideas
Design curriculum, work in leadership position w/ a class.
30 hours.
Have to put fellowship on pause while you do it.

Chris' class.
	- only 5 though, not ideal
Teaching a class should fulfill all requirements
Critical Making
	- Spring
CS 160
	- when they teach Android 
	- Spring 2018 might be Bjoern
	- Fall 2018 might be Eric (would want to do AR thing, might be w/ Android...maybe not)
What else?
	- Can influence what classes you choose to take in the future
	- Kimiko's classes (they have some pressure to take ISchool students)

##### DIS
Think bigger again
Introducing new clothing interactions...
Gestural textiles
Input side also possible now - can add that back in
Want something SUPER WEIRD w/ magnets - floating eddy current damping magic

Interface that appears
Movement vocabulary (bunching, twisting, wrinkling, flipping)
Epaulet
(this could go into NSF stuff too)

Another connection: 
	- AR thing
	- could be programmed in AR
	- programming by performance (rather than by demonstration)
	- pair performative programming
	- emphasizes public/semi-public aspect

--> Eric will have some NSF proposal around wearables, will send me some text. due 27 Sept.
--> Do we need to order more parts? Look into this.
--> Look at recent TEI, older wearable conferences (Int'l Symposium Wearable Computing) maybe got morphed into something else
--> 

##### Paper structure
why are these the way they are?
	- provides job, tenure, etc.
	- explains idea
	- helps reproduce something
	- hyper-embedded in the publishing world (whole separate industry)


DIS pushed back
	- Bill Gavers' notebooks vs papers
	- for some design contributions pictorial format makes more sense
	- new pictorial track at DIS

Interpretive dance of PhD thesis
- what are more effective ways of communicating information.
- Dorkbot talk?
- Twitter

- accreditation
