### Agenda

#### New research direction / DIS plans

Audience augmentation
  - back channel to performer
  - feedback to audience, quantify in some way the experience, define who they were most closely "synchronized with" (character? performer? etc.)
  - 

Ballet picture
  - costumes wearing the people instead of the other way around.
  - intentionally restrictive in very weird ways
  - reinterpret constrained motion
  - do they have meaning
  - re-do the performance somehow?
  - what if audience could influence the constriction (but that's kind of the same control loop)
  
Costume 
  - augmented reality on phone, even a little thing for selfies or whatever
  - augmented reality mirror
  - shared experience
  - timing, relationship/coproduced w/ audience

Overview of research style
  - work w/ local performance group to generate something that then applies to a broader design of other things
  - interactive, wearable, messaging (person to person)
  - onstage: there's some emotional impact someone wants to have, how do you communicate that.
  - some structured way to create something for them, interview performer on how they adapted to the costume, 
  
AR for programming clothing
  
#### Brief check-ins.

- Spring 2018 classes
- Other fellowships?
