1. Let's start w/ Jefferson Han's paper, can you describe the technology behind how that paper worked?
*Draw the screen, with the light, and a camera, and draw a flat version w/ smudges*
(I'm obviously missing a lot of details here about how it worked - it's clear Eric isn't happy)
Let's go into more detail about how it worked - what it was capable of, why this paper stood out for the time, what else were people doing, and what was different about this one? 
*Struggle*
What other types of sensor setups did people have, and what was differnet about this? People might have been able to recognize a single point of contact (I drew a grid on the board and talked about how you certain gestures would be difficult to recognize like a swipe). I talked about fidelity (he pointed out that a lower quality camera would have the same fidelity issue)

What were some of the limitations, what didn't work?
Were you able to track more than one person at a time, how about different hands? What about objects (I compared w/ dry hands)
What different interaction modes were enabled by this new technology? What else could you do differently with this table? (I mentioned having multiple people touch it, I eventually stumbled towards pinch and zoom, I talked about gestures. I said some random stuff about collaboration and the interface remembering you over time.)

Things I mentioned:
- Limitations: dry skin, lighting conditions, smudges, big gap behind the substrate for the camera/lighting setup
- Multiple people could interact with it (mostly making this up), it could remember an individual over time
- We didn't understand the historical context of why this paper was included in the reading list.


WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
- Specific technical details, how this differed from what had come before.
- Limitations both technically, and in terms of the types of interactions it enabled.
- The types of interactions that were supported, and how that was different from what came before.

2. Parallel Prototyping
Describe the study (I started off w/ the other one Getting the Design Right but quickly corrected myself). Covered a bit of the motivation, the procedure, and the evaluation, and the results. I described their hypotheses as
Success
Diversity
Self-efficacy

How did they measure these?
I talked about click-through rates on web-sites, "expert" ratings, and a survey and an interview.
How did they rate the different final designs?
Pairwise comparison w/ Mechanical Turk.
Asking about self-efficacy isn't something you would normally do in an open-ended interview process, so how did they do that?
I re-emphasized the survey
Yes but would just one survey cover it?
Oh - they asked a survey before the experiment as well.

Can you describe some theoretical reasons behind why they might have chosen "success, diversity, and self-efficacy"?
I talked about the hill-climbing, that generating more diverse designs may randomly sample from the larger design space, and therefore you'll hill-climb up towards a local optima rather than the global optima. (Canny said this covered both success and diversity).

Were there any obvious problems that stood out w/ their experimental design?
No....
Yes but how was the experimenter involved? Eventually lead me to the fact that the experimenter was not blind to the condition, so may have been likely to rate them based on preconceived notions.
I pointed out that the fact that they had independent raters compare them which gives it a little better.

Canny then drew some data on the board
mean(std)
Parallel: 31(134)
Sequential: 13(80)

What problem would you see here in this data, or what concerns do you have?
There's a lot of overlap there, but didn't they do a T-test? Can't I trust statistics? (Canny: a piece of advice never trust how someone's done it in a paper, this is probably fine for complicated reasons). 

WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
- Details of the experiment, how it was run, what their findings were. (Level of detail: how did they actually do the comparison to see diversity? (pairwise comparison) Who did the comparison (Mechanical Turk workers))
- Theoretical motivations behind what they looked for and found (local minima vs greater chance of global minima).
- Obvious problems w/ the experimental design or how it was run (critical thought).
- Analysis of specific data samples (provided by questioners)


3. 1992 - Beyond Being There
What was the point of this paper? It was somewhat controversial.
A lot of technology is being built around the unstated goal of recreating physical colocation, where we're striving towards this goal of perfectly recreating the experience of being in the same location, what if instead we talked about this as only one of many possible media? That kind of opens up questions of what does face-to-face interactions lack/do poorly/not do at all/ etc.
What is Being There - I don't know what that means. 
I emphasize face-to-face and that a person at a distance should not feel like they're at a disadvantage to someone who's physically there. I mentioned skype / the old video-conferencing system they describe.

I then talked about the 5 projects, and listed the various advantages and talked in great detail about the hypotheses

You've talked a lot about the projects, what were the higher-level concepts that the authors wanted to explore? What else besides physical proximity should we use to measure?
I stumbled around a bit, and then mentioned social presence and ...."richness of information"

Why would this paper have been controversial?
People at the time would have been wanting to push technology forward and always increase it, and this paper sort of argues that that is wasted energy, and that the field woud be better served by moving in different directions.

Give examples of technology - you mentioned Skype - are there any other examples of modern technology, or where technology might go based on this?
I describe HoloLens, where you're literally sharing the same view - seeing through their eyes. It's actually better than being physically there, because if you're pointing to the part of the sink that needs fixing, you'll occlude their view, but this annotation can hang in the air, and you won't block them. I also talked about how the old phone sounded like you were farther away, which actually helped people mentally and emotionally experience the distance, so increased sound fidelity would actually lower the quality of the experience.

WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
- Details about the philosophy of the piece.
- Core concepts and ideas.
- Speculation about why it might be controversial.
- Modern implementations / interpretations of the core concepts.

4. Ben Schneiderman's CST he talked about 4 things 
Collect
Relate
Create
Donate

I describe them, but when I describe "Relate" I focus on relating the concepts to each other (Canny) looks up sharply as I say this, but I have no idea what I missed. He tells me later that most people describe it that way, but that the important part from Schneiderman was relating to other people, to peers and so on. I talked about how he defines creativity rather broadly.
He gives the example of creating a family album, and asks if there is any technology relating to that that exists now (I mention Ancestry.com, FB, and 23andMe). He points out facial recognition.

Canny then writes all 8 of the tasks up on the board and says he hopes I had some critical reactions to these as I was reading the paper, and perhaps I'd like to talk about which seem to have stuck around, which seem to have fallen out of favor, if there is any technology that exists that supports this type of work, which seems to be "Schneiderman"-specific, etc.
I talk a little bit about Search and he shares that he thinks Search is an outdated term, to which I have a big reaction. He talks about how his kids use Google to search for specific pieces of knowledge, and I emphasize that while that's a part of search, another part is understanding what already exists, and placing yourself in the larger context of the work that's been done. We also talked about the distinction between Disemmination and Consulting w/ peers. I talked about my experience with Qualcomm where they don't provide any documentation, even to their larger customers, setting aside questions of Open Software and licenses, they don't help them at all.  I talk about ml4a and how that fits into the 8 tasks, and describe what you're able to do with ml4a, and why it's valuable and how it matches Schneiderman's.

WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
- personal, critical reaction, especially critiquing Schneiderman's perspective/viewpoint.
- Accurate interpretation/understanding of Schneiderman's philosophy.
- Core concepts, and modern interpretations/examples of them.
- Analysis of what aspects of this have continued on to this day, and what have been left behind.
