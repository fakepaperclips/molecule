      - [More](http://www2.eink.com/flexible.html)
  - Recruit graphic designers, or anyone who designs pins
  - It doesn't change the "look" of clothing enough to really qualify as changing fashion. Embrace this.
      - Update a message on a lunchbox a kid takes to school.
      - Update a message on the door before you leave for the day - reminders.
      - Update the message on the door AS you leave...
      - A little sign on your backpack: "pinned tweet" style (who wants this?)
      - Phone case animation (what's the power draw?)
  - What are we investigating? Changed relationship to technology? Flexible fashion? (Don't think change is enough to support this).
