This is advice for how to choose an HCI research project from the graduate-level HCI Research class at UC Berkeley!

__________________________________

Choosing an ambitious and yet feasible project is the black art of research. There are two important keystones to making this work: 1) read a lot of papers in an area of interest, and 2) generate a lot of ideas.

What makes something "research"? The high-order bit is that you are introducing an idea into the world. The terms to avoid are "advanced development" (vs. systems research) and "usability study" (vs. social science research), both of which indicate iterating on someone else's idea. If you are thinking of a systems-oriented contribution, then your idea needs to be the first one to propose an approach to the design of interactive systems. If you are thinking of a social science-oriented contribution, then your idea should be teaching us something general about people or their interactions with technology.

The goal of the assignment is to learn to distill contributions to HCI research. A good scaffold for doing this initially is to build on prior research. Here are some suggestions when generating ideas:

Just proposing using a technology in a new place is not enough. "New problem old technique" only works if the old technique is NOT KNOWN to HCI. Example: machine learning on electrical noise to detect electrical events in the home. You can't take an HCI technique and apply it to another HCI problem — that's no longer research.
Feasibility. Remember this is a semester long class. Make sure you scope your project so it's accomplishable in that timeframe. This includes making sure the population needed for your study is available.
Beware of super sensors and complex hardware. Building new technology takes time.
Using Google Scholar's "cited by" feature to discover related work.
If you're going to base the idea on another paper, you need to read the other paper.
The purpose of the Project Ideas assignment is to help you generate many ideas. Along the way, you will see a lot of papers. For this assignment, work as a group to generate ten proposed research projects that would fit within the scope of this semester long course. Do not split up and each contribute a few ideas — work together on this. The ideas may cover any topic and any method covered (e.g., building systems, studying people): check with me in office hours if you are unsure of fit.

For each project idea, give it a title, describe the core contribution in 2-3 sentences (i.e., what the HCI community will learn), and explain what exactly you're planning to build or what the method will be for the study you are planning. In addition, for each idea, cite one published paper or article that is a central piece of published, academic related work, and describe its relevance to your idea.

From those ten ideas, select 1) your most logical idea, 2) your most unexpected idea, and 3) your idea most likely to inspire. Label these LOGICAL, UNEXPECTED, INSPIRE and list those three first in your list of full ten ideas in your submission.

Use Google Scholar as well as the references section in papers listed in this course to start poking through related work. Look ahead to topics later in the class for inspiration. We encourage you to join existing HCI research opportunities for your class project.

The grading rubric is attached to this assignment. Instead of grading all 10 ideas, your grade will be based on the top 3. This will produce the highest scores and will also allow us to nudge you towards projects that may have the greatest potential. If you want to pursue an idea outside of the 3 you were given feedback on, please meet with me to discuss that idea prior to submitting your project abstract.

Number all 10 of your project ideas so that feedback can be given by numerical reference into one submission.

Example (without refs, etc) ...

 

1. LOGICAL – Study trust relationship with messaging with and without motion animations

2. UNEXPECTED – Mouth saliva measurements used to improve signal for speech authentication

3. INSPIRE Use Infrasound to control internal body sensations

4. Robots used to support Alzheimers patents in home care

5....
