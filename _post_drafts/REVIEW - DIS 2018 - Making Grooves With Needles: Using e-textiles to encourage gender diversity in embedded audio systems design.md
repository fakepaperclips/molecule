### Random thoughts
- really picky, but confusion when reading abstract and then intro since it's not clear whta's new yet: introducing e-textiles to audio or if that's an existing practice this paper is simply examining in more depth.
- love that findings are expressed in abstract
- again very picky but first paragraph of seciton 2 is very repetitive.
- Very picky: Awkward phrasing of "Once within the audio technology culture".
- It's very good, but if you need more room you could probably compress the "Intro to E-Textiles" section.
- just the right level of detail in E-Textile Practitioners section. Well-organized and wonderfully written.
- A transition from E-textile section to the case study would be very helpful! The paper suddenly shifts here and it's jarring and unclear. By this point, I"ve forgotten your "four steps", so a reminder of the structure of hte paper would be great. I'd even add one sentence before and after the other sections as well.

#### Section 4: Workshop Case Study
Overall, this section is the most poorly organized and confusing to read in the paper. The information is relevant and important, but the organization makes it difficult to parse. For example, the third paragraph ends very suddenly with "This survey gathered 251 responses." I'm expecting information about the survey like the findings. Instead, it transitions abruptly to the other survey. I'd recommend making two labeled subsections "Broader community online survey" and "Survey of audio workshop participants". The info from the two different surveys needs to be separated and clarified to better communicate the process and findings. Can you also clarify the two survey audiences? You seem to refer to the "larger community of Bela users" as "Bela users", but the people in the workshop are also using Bela, right? Just define a term that clarifies them ("Online Bela community" vs "Workshop Bela users" or similar) and use that to refer to them. See here for a particularly confusing section:

```
Each group had a similar age distribution, and though the Bela group had more experience
with different technology platforms, the workshop was experienced with two of those platforms.
```

"The workshop" -> "The workshop participants"
The workshop participants are also using Bela, right? So why refer to only the online community as the "Bela" group?

Throughout this section you discuss both online communitiy and the workshop attendees at the same time. I understand that you're trying to show that they're similar, but it's hard for readers to understand the big picture when we keep flipping back and forth between these two surveys. Start with one, completely describe it, and then when you go to the second population you can either describe them there, or add a third section specifically calling out the similarities. THe Motivation section is a fine way to do this (as long as you change how you talk about the populations, as I suggested above).

- Phrasing: "Both sets of surveys" is it a set of surveys or is it two surveys? It seems small but at this point I keep getting confused about how many populations and surveys you've done.

#### Section 5
In general, this section could use a bit more clarity. I believe it's clear to you, the researchers, what the take-aways are, but we the readers really need our hands held a little more. In particular, as I'm reading these sections I'm looking for the answers to these questions: 1. What are specific things I can do, as someone creating a workshop or a new technology, that will encourage women to participate? 2. What are your theories about why women aren't engaging now, succinctly phrased, so I can avoid those things in my own workshops? Please help future workshop designers by writing out your findings as clearly as possible!

This section also seems to veer back into "Related Work" section a bit too much. Please instead use the space to expand on your findings! I'm especially unclear on how "pluggable communities" relates to your own workshops.

**Knowledge Creation Section**

As I read through this, it's hard to know what to take away. It's very dense. As someone unfamiliar with much of this literature, I feel lost in terminology and dense sentences. The third paragraph in particular is very hard to understand. You have an amazing opportunity here to bring your knowledge and understanding of these topics to the broader research community! Please expand and clarify this section. Consider this chunk: "Code proposes that second persons inform how knowledge is created through empathetic knowledge and ecological thinking as opposed to “spectator epistemologies” — colloquially, “bouncing ideas off each other” as a method for the formation of knowledge." In particular, I'm not sure it adequately expresses the notion of "second persons". I also don't come away with an understanding of what spectator epistemologies are, or especially, how this is related to the rest of the paper.









- This is a little dense, can it be rephrased, perhaps broken into several sentences? 
- conclusion is just a long summary. See Wobbrock's excellent explanation for how a paper should look: https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/Wobbrock-2015.pdf
- The authors keep claiming more women "remain" in the community, but I didn't see the data for that. Was there a long-term survey study that shows this?

#### Typos
- 1st paragraph of section 2: missing period at end of last sentence.
- pg 2 "and there a large body of science" -> "and there IS/EXISTS a large body of science"
- weird grammer (plural? not plural?) "g. Orth’s work, which is recognized as the first publications in the field, developed novel applications for textile interfaces embroidered with conductive threads and adapted existing fabrics that happened to have conductive properties into circuit substrates"
- "Arduino platform, a open source" -> "Arduino platform, aN open source"
- missing word: "playing sounds from that places"
- typo of some kind "Bela to process the measures sensor data."
- typo of some kind "professional qualifications as the group as there were more individuals"
-  missing word: "can be used a means to conduct" -> "can be used AS a means to conduct"
- Tense shifting: "we will examine the responses gathered via two different surveys." -> I think past tense is more typical.
