### Positive
The authors approached the question of why more women aren't involved in the interactive audio industry in several different ways (surveys, literature review, and workshop experiences). Because of their multi-pronged approach, they were able to generate insights that are relevant to a much broader set of fields. Their insights are mostly well-communicated, and the overall organization of the paper is looking great (see below for specifics about what I think needs updating). This paper is a valuable contribution to increasing engagement with a population that is currently underserved. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of the importance of tools and community. The "Intro to E-Textiles" section is very good, but if the authors need more room they could probably compress it a bit. The authors struck just the right level of detail in E-Textile Practitioners section: it is well-organized and wonderfully written. The findings are helpfully expressed in the abstract.

### Opportunities for Improvement

#### Recommendations, summarized
- Reorganize section 4, with new subsections and clarified terminology.
- Clarify and simplify section 5, focusing on making theories understandable to a broader audience, clarifying relevance to the paper, and explicitly and clearly stating recommendations for future researchers and practitioners. (see the excellent level of detail and explanatory power of your 'intro to e-textiles section' for an example!).
- The authors keep claiming more women "remain" in the community, but I didn't see the data for that. Was there a long-term survey study that shows this? Can they clarify where they're getting support for that conclusion?
- Fix typos.

#### Section 4: Workshop Case Study
Overall, this section is the most poorly organized and confusing to read in the paper. The information is relevant and important, but the organization makes it difficult to parse. For example, the third paragraph ends very suddenly with "This survey gathered 251 responses." At this point, I was expecting information about the survey like the findings. Instead, it transitions abruptly to the other survey. I'd recommend making two labeled subsections "Broader community online survey" and "Survey of audio workshop participants". 

The info from the two different surveys needs to be separated and clarified to better communicate the process and findings. Can you also clarify the two survey audiences? You seem to refer to the "larger community of Bela users" as "Bela users", but the people in the workshop are also using Bela, right? Just define a term that clarifies them ("Online Bela community" vs "Workshop Bela users" or similar) and use that to refer to them. See here for a particularly confusing section:

```
Each group had a similar age distribution, and though the Bela group had more experience
with different technology platforms, the workshop was experienced with two of those platforms.
```

"The workshop" -> "The workshop participants"
The workshop participants are also using Bela, right? So why refer to only the online community as the "Bela" group?

Throughout this section you discuss both online communitiy and the workshop attendees at the same time. I understand that you're trying to show that they're similar, but it's hard for readers to understand the big picture when we keep flipping back and forth between these two surveys. Consider starting with one, completely describe it, and then when you go to the second population you can either describe them there, or add a third section specifically calling out the similarities. THe Motivation section is a fine way to do this (as long as you change how you talk about the populations, as I suggested above).

- Phrasing: "Both sets of surveys" is it a set of surveys or is it two surveys? It seems small but at this point I keep getting confused about how many populations and surveys you've done.
- A transition from the E-textile section to the case study would be very helpful! The paper suddenly shifts here and it's jarring and unclear. By this point, I"ve forgotten your "four steps", so a reminder of the structure of hte paper would be great. I'd even add one transition sentence before and after the other sections as well.

### Section 5
In general, this section could use a bit more clarity. I believe it's clear to you, the researchers, what the take-aways are, but we the readers really need our hands held a little more. In particular, as I'm reading these sections I'm looking for the answers to these questions: 1. What are specific things I can do, as someone creating a workshop or a new technology, that will encourage women to participate? 2. What are your theories about why women aren't engaging now, succinctly phrased, so I can avoid those things in my own workshops? Please help future workshop designers by writing out your findings as clearly as possible!

**Knowledge Creation Section**
As I read through this, it's hard to know what to take away. It's very dense. As someone unfamiliar with these specific references, I feel lost in terminology and dense sentences. The third paragraph in particular is very hard to understand. You have an amazing opportunity here to bring your knowledge and understanding of these topics to the broader research community! Please expand and clarify this section. Consider this chunk: "Code proposes that second persons inform how knowledge is created through empathetic knowledge and ecological thinking as opposed to “spectator epistemologies” — colloquially, “bouncing ideas off each other” as a method for the formation of knowledge." In particular, I'm not sure it adequately expresses the notion of "second persons". I also don't come away with an understanding of what spectator epistemologies are, or especially, how this is related to the rest of the paper. Your earlier sections on e-textiles are a perfect example of how to do this well!

**Community**
The "Community" section seems to veer back into "Related Work" section a bit too much. Please instead use the space to expand on your findings! I'm especially unclear on how "pluggable communities" relates to your own workshops.

**Tools**
Hidden in the final paragraph of the tools section is the fact that you created a custom tool to support sewing Bela into fabric? This seems like a very interesting project, and I look forward to reading about it in the future!

### Very picky suggestions
- Very picky: Awkward phrasing of "Once within the audio technology culture".
- again very picky but first paragraph of section 2 is very repetitive.
- really picky, but I was confused when reading abstract and then the intro since it's not clear what you did yet: introducing e-textiles to audio or if that's an existing practice this paper is simply examining in more depth.


### Typos
- 1st sentence of Abstract! Whoopsies. It happens to the best of us. "Historically, women been excluded from engineering and computer science disciplines, and interactive audio is no exception" -> "Historically, women HAVE been excluded from engineering and computer science disciplines, and interactive audio is no exception."
- 1st paragraph of section 2: missing period at end of last sentence.
- pg 2 "and there a large body of science" -> "and there IS/EXISTS a large body of science"
- weird grammer (plural? not plural?) "g. Orth’s work, which is recognized as the first publications in the field, developed novel applications for textile interfaces embroidered with conductive threads and adapted existing fabrics that happened to have conductive properties into circuit substrates"
- "Arduino platform, a open source" -> "Arduino platform, aN open source"
- missing word: "playing sounds from that places"
- typo of some kind "Bela to process the measures sensor data."
- typo of some kind "professional qualifications as the group as there were more individuals"
-  missing word: "can be used a means to conduct" -> "can be used AS a means to conduct"
- Tense shifting: "we will examine the responses gathered via two different surveys." -> I think past tense is more typical.
