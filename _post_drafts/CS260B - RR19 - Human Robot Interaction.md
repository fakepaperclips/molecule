### Design patterns for sociality in human-robot interaction. 

### To Beam or Not to Beam: A Study of Remote Telepresence Attendance at an Academic Conference.

### Help Me Please: Robot Politeness Strategies for Soliciting Help From Humans.

I'm struck by these choices! I took Anca Dragan's excellent Algorithmic Human Robot Interaction course and even the more HCI-"HRI"-type papers were super algorithmic. I loooove this unique ways of eliciting help from humans for robots! I'm fascinated by the fact that people were 50% more likely to help a robot they perceived as autonomous (even though the idea of what counts as autonomous is probably not well-defined by the participants!)

It's so cool to see work continue Eric's earlier work on telepresence. This is something I find particularly thrilling about academia! The long narratives that slowly evolve over time.  However, their findings w/ the speaker quality were already identified by Eric...this is the downside of Academic research: it's not always actually incorporated into products. I like the format of this paper, w/ sections clearly labeled and Recommendations summarized below each section. For folks without the mobility challenges of their users, what's the difference between using a Beam to attend a conference, and just watching videos of the same talks on youtube later? I don't think all academic research needs to generalize to everyone, but I do appreciate when researchers just acknowledge the limitations of their work. (This seems like it would be great for folks w/ limited mobility).

I looooove the notion of design patterns in general, so it's always fun to see design patterns done well in a new domain. The question of validation is particularly interesting, so it was great to see this included.
