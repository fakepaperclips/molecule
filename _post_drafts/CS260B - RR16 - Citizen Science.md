#### A vehicle for research: using street sweepers to explore the landscape of environmental community action.

I love the theme of using "invisible infrastructure" (trash cans, street sweeping, etc) for research! I know this was a few years after the trash can project, but I am still inspired by this idea, and it makes me try to think of other objects in our day-to-day lives that are typically invisible that could be fruitful sites for research. Quick question: do street sweepers actually sweep streets? I've seen them drive but 1) the brushes don't seem to actually touch the ground and 2) streets that never get swept (like the one I live on) seem just as clean as those who get swept....I have always suspected it's a scam to get parking ticket money.

My favorite part of this paper is the "critical perspectives" on citizen sensing. It's extraordinarily useful to see specific expected resistances to these kinds of provocative probes for other researchers who want to replicate this work. This seems like another fruitful way to translate controversial "artsy" projects into useful data for researchers. The specific resistances also seemed to suggest future opportunities for exploration: mental models of regulatory systems, and understandings of citizen role in society.

conducting studies) who were perceived as promising a

support, and ultimately delivering nothing of relevance.

Ouch....I'm also a little uncomfortable with the authors following that up with a discussion of strategies they learned to "build credibility" without a call to making datasets available, contributing actionable guidelines back to the community, and otherwise closing the loop on these types of research projects (in other words it feels like they're just "performing" credibility, not actually having it. being it? Being credible? You know what I'm saying). They next emphasized how data must be designed for action, but many of the recommendations were about whether something was "perceived" as being for action. That seems fundamentally different and while I recognize the importance of taking into account perceptions, this makes me a little uncomfortable. Then again I've been working for over 12 hours so I may just be not reading this right. 

#### App Movement: A Platform for Community Commissioning of Mobile Applications.

I love the focus on a platform that supports more community-level engagement with the design of new technologies! This project seems so impactful that it almost doesn't feel like research! (#burn?). I'm particularly impressed with the longitudinal study they did. If I were doing work in this space, this seems like an extremely useful resource. However, I do question the actual wisdom of the crowd in projects like this: we like design experts because they're trained in design....why do we assume random people have good ideas? (does this make me crotchety).

I do wonder: for systems like this, who's really going to use it? I mean Kickstarter and IndieGogo are industry standards now, but it's a little hard to imagine something like this having a solid business model. And I don't think I want the government involved....(except possibly via a non-profit?). But if not researchers, who? 

I struggled to understand what exactly the authors meant by "movement" until the case studies. Perhaps a quick few sentences early on could have clarified. 

Are the particular apps that came out of this important? Or is the more interesting part **what** the crowds are coming up with? In other words: this is an interesting way to gauge the concerns and desires of the broader community, which could inform designs by entrepreneurs, researchers, or government bodies. Ok, maybe I"m just cantankerous...

I appreciated the section on Social Media Literacy and the Need-Understanding gap! 

The Related Work identifies ways in which gatekeeping behaviors limit participation in the creation of technological artifacts. But on the other side: I don't want some random person who's brand-new to C++ to contribute to my project. In other words, there's a difference between gate-keeping and just having standards or expectations. And even though I'm drawn to direct action on society, I find myself wondering if that's the best role for researchers? Isn't that more a social worker's or activist's job?

I do find myself drawn to the idea that consumers of technology should be able to influence the design of the systems we use (for instance: I'd love to have more control over how facebook operates). 

THe authors emphasize a "democratic process" but in democracies we elect leaders who appoint cabinet members who make decisions. Being involved in every decision takes time, energy, and expertise, which arguably the crowd doesn't have. Not to mention the potential for one large group to decide things, or the reverse problem death by committee..this just seems fundamentally like a flawed idea to me. The goal of "allow[ing] every community member to have an equal say" sounds like an actual nightmare I've had. On the other hand, maybe engaging non-traditional participants on the design process, they'll also have a different understanding/appreciation for app development. This also reminds me of Wikipedia, which everyone thought would fail. Instead, a dedicated subset of users took over and contribute the bulk of material, and most people just consume.
