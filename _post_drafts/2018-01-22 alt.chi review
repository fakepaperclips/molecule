### Random thoughts
- cite James? yes.
- Love the weekend clock. Consider other ideas: a clock that moves in slow motion, or that moves more quickly so it's a pleasant surprise to realize not so much time has passed? Or customizable?
- why only 2? why both male? How were they chosen? Why? Was their insight expected to be valuable somehow?
- Not supported by existing user quotes: "the described confrontations with the functionality show in-depth reflections on the kind of practices the participants develop developed while building a relationship with the artifact." 
- Pg. 7, great user quote: "“I started setting the alarm when I was going to bed.
And then a couple of deadlines kicked in and I realized
that I probably have to sleep less to catch up with my
work. So, I started setting the alarm at like 11[pm] and
still be working at 2 or 3 in the morning. [..] But then I
just wasn’t as focused anymore. Because of it was in
the back of my mind now. I had to set the alarm, that
yeah right, I should to go to sleep. I feel without
setting the alarm at that point I might just have kept
on working and that thought ‘I should sleep’ would
have never crossed my mind.” [P1]"

### Typoes
- Page 2, Fig. 1: "believe" --> "belief"
- Weird phrasing / punctuation. Pg. 2, paragraph that starts "We believe this implicit moralizing...", last sentence
- Pg 2, 2nd column, 1st paragraph "project that set" --> "project that sets"
- Pg. 3, Fig. 4. Modus -> mode. Possible both are correct, though, but I've only ever seen mode.
- Pg. 3: "differnet" -> "different"
- Pg. 3: "focusses" -> "focuses"
- Pg. 3: "focussed" -> "focused"
- Pg. 5: "working a side" -> "working on a side"
- Pg. 5: Pierce’s and Paulus’s -> The authors names are Pearce and Paulos
- Pg. 6: "develop developed" -> "developed"
- Pg. 5, Pg. 7, Pg.8, Pg. 9: " moral believe" -> "moral belief"
