### Beyond Being There

#### Fundamental reorganization
I love how this paper questions the fundamental role of telecommunication technology. Apparently this paper was quite controversial at the time, because it sort of implies that all the work towards improving sensors and communications protocols and so on is missing the point. This paper makes me feel like my brain is a flower that's finally found the sun, and is opening up in totally new directions. I wonder if Jim Hollan or Scott Stornetta knew what kind of response they'd get with this work - it's somewhat gently written, with a slow build to the thesis (so gentle that in fact when I first read this I read it twice before realizing how softly I had been introduced to their idea).

This paper is another example of the kind of research I love: a refocusing on technology that's there to support an experience, rather than on just flashy new technology. Sotto Voce and Familiar Stranger both fit this pattern. This is one of the earliest papers I'm aware of that does this.

The introduction of the terms *needs*, *media*, and *mechanisms* particularly clarified their thoughts here. It's like a fish suddenly realizing they're swimming in water: by identifying the infrastructure everyone was striving towards, they allowed researchers to step outside that infrastructure and see it in a new light.Brilliant!!  

#### Obsessed with email
It's not only this paper: a number of early HCI authors identified email as the bastion of communication or interactive systems. And it's true that aside from some cosmetic changes, email really hasn't fundamentally changed. I wonder if anyone writes similar love-notes to the telephone (which also hasn't changed much) or the car. What is it about email that seems so exciting? I'm honestly not convinced that it deserves all the love...

#### Feedback, Clarity and Archive

I really wonder what Hollan and Stornetta would say about the systems we currently have available to us. Do they think telecommunications has lived up to its promise? What do they view as successes and failures?

- Clarity: I'm not sure if this one exists in online spaces...I mean there is a greater tendency to manipulate syntax, punctuation, and formatting in order to communicate rich emotional affect. Do we think communication through technology is more or less clear? Considering inviting someone to dinner over text, and them responding only with "K.". With a period!!! If that doesn't give you immediate heart palpitations you should visit your doctor.

- Feedback: there are some examples of telecommunications systems allowing greater feedback. The recent (a few months ago?) iOS update that allows iMessage users to respond to specific messages w/ a few preselected options is an example. On the other hand, I saw a tweet a while ago that said the main problem with systems like Twitter isn't that they are hard to talk on, it's that there are very few ways to indicate *listening*. They argued that this resulted in a lot of miscommunications. Hollan gives the examples of imprecise facial expressions or head nodding, but my only options on Twitter are "like" "retweet" "reply" or "quote" - I think it's actually worse there...and I would maybe argue that an online experience could NEVER really provide rich enough feedback...

- Archive: This part is undeniable. The archival qualities of email / online systems is generally excellent (which is why it's SUCH a surprise that it's nearly impossible to search through your Twitter archive. It's so bad it almost makes me want to quit using it).

### PRoP: Personal Roving Presence

#### Adorable historical references 

Repeated use of "WWW" is v v v v charming. 
Actually using one of Asimov's laws in the design: omg.

#### Evolution of a researcher

Favorite paragraph: 
```
We believe that any human communication beyond the very simplest cannot be 
ascribed a unique or personal meaning. We are further motivated by 
Wittgenstein who succinctly expressed that communication is about 
connotation (what the communication could mean) and not about denotation 
(some particular meaning). Post-structural literary theory underlines the 
importance of social, political, and historical context in the 
understanding of any text. It illustrates just how complex the meaning of 
short “symbolic” text can be. It also explains why symbolic representations 
such as text are capable of such great richness.
```

I feel like in that paragraph we're seeing a hint of the Eric-to-come. References to really cool non-technical literature? Check. List of three contexts, separated by commas? Check. 

#### Immersive
What makes an experience immersive? At one point, the authors state that when the PRoP had a "mind of its own" it was the "opposite" of an immersive experience. But I've been immersed while horse back-riding, where the animal literally had a mind of its own (and jumped us both over a creek without my input). What actually makes for an immersive experience? I appreciate all the different aspects the authors explored in this paper: technical, visual, "reflexivity" (my favourite).

#### Other opportunities
They said the height made a big difference: manipulating height could be a fascinating way to affect social relationships. Would a tall person learn something new about themselves by using a shorter telepresence robot? 

I also felt like they didn't take full advantage of the digital aspect. The visual time-line was a good example, but why mimic the 'walking around' part of searching for a coffee shop? (I guess back then Google maps didn't really exist....).
