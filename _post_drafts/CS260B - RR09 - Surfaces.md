#### DiamondTouch: A Multi-User Touch Technology 
UIST 2001

Projector-based (limited lighting conditions)
How does it know who is interacting? What if someone has only one arm? Does it work for black people?
Did they come up w/ this list of requirements before or after developing their thing? (I bet a little of both). Also everyone does this, am I really gonna throw a fit about it?

OH SHIT it generates a different electrical signal to the part of the table they wish to touch, that's awesome. Wow talk about human in the loop. Don't just read a signal, generate a signal, pipe it through the user, and read that signal back...so cool.

It can't tell where on the antenna a person is touching, so thte size of the antennas determines the size you're able to track? OH DANG their pixels are super small:  "a typical finger touch would span at least two rows and two columns." 

Leverages social norms of touching - this is a cool way to use that, but also limits the tech from being culturally universal (is any tech actually culturally universal?). Also awesome to exploit it!! Will they talk about the social dynamics afforded by an interfaces that can actually use touching? How many people "deep" can it sense? 

Discussion of objects that could be interactive: appreciate this "reach across the aisle"

Sorry what??
"Our prototype was made from a fiberglass laminate called GML1000 [9], whose thermal properties allowed us to operate the table temporarily (and without damage) while it was covered with burning alcohol."

Related work later...interesting choice...can't decide how I feel.

Software defined personal workspaces. Good focus on actual advantages of digital aspect.

This seems like it was a tool built for another purpose, then redirected into a paper. Smart!

#### Interacting with Paper on the Digital Desk

Reasons for why paper hasn't disappeared: are these the real reasons? How about just laziness, or difficulty/cost in digitizing? (hospitals) plus major downsides of digitizing: hospitals being held ransom for unlocking their digital systems.

Goofy graphics.

**FORMATTING:**
Example applications came first, which helped me understand the tech, before the tech was described.

Fingertapping seems pretty sketchy. 

DynamicLand!!!

Love the discussion of different techniques, including those that didn't work. Deep appreciation of this transparency. 

Funny:

#### Social Immersive Media: Pursuing Best Practices for Multi-user Interactive Camera/projector Exhibits

"Our work abandons GUI metaphors and builds on the language of cinema, casting users as actors within simulated narrative
models."
Finally! Though: Why cinema? Why not dance or another socially immersive experience?

#### General
What use-cases do they describe, which are more compelling?
DiamondTouch doesn't cite Wellner!! Why not?
Wellner: paper is good, let's keep it. DiamondTouch: no discussion of paper advantages? 

Philosophical differences:
"The purpose of the DigitalDesk is not to convert paper into electronic documents; it is to support rapid and direct computer based interaction with selected regions of paper documents." DiamondTouch doesn't really seem to have a philosophical vision.

Wellner: here are some limitations. DiamondTouch: fuck you we're perfect.

Focus on unencumbered: DiamondTouch and Social Immersive.
