#### DiamondTouch: A Multi-User Touch Technology 
UIST 2001

When I started reading this paper, I thought the technology would be the standard camera-tracking hand shapes around a table, with some heuristics to make assumptions about whose hand was whose. (It would still have been interesting as the first to approach this challenging problem). I was pleasantly surprised that the researchers created a unique system that I had never imagined. I particularly liked their focus on "unencumbered" interactions. The many videos available are pretty impressive and compelling! I'm interested in the cyborgian implications of a "human in the loop" system like this (and I wonder if it is safe for someone with a pacemaker or an IUD to use? Or anyone with metal in their body). I especially appreciated the focus on the advantages of the digital realm (software defined workspaces), but I was surprised that they didn't discuss their philosophy behind why they created this more.

Any project that uses a projector is limited to darker spaces, and this is no exception. It also sounds like the tech was difficult to make in large sizes at the time. I wonder what kind of progress has been made since. I also didn't see any discussion in the paper of how reliable it was - this seems crucial to a proposal like this. The paper format made it a little difficult to decide how effective/efficient their design was. I was particularly surprised that they didn't discuss the affordances of paper at all. In some ways, this feels more like a marketing brochure than a research paper. They describe a single game, and talk about some motivations behind the tech, but it didn't seem like they had explored the ramifications of their designs as much as they could have. In particular, they briefly mention that it can tell when someone is touching through someone else, which is a fascinating capability. I wish they had gone into more detail on that! I did appreciate the hat tip to tangibility w/ their discussion of objects that could be interactive, but it still felt a little brief. The Related Work section didn't appear until the end of the paper. Related Work can help define the context of a paper, and further motivate the designs, so I dislike this style of putting it near the end.

The most baffling sentence in the paper: "Our prototype was made from a fiberglass laminate called GML1000 [9], whose thermal properties allowed us to operate the table temporarily (and without damage) while it was covered with burning alcohol." I really wish they had gone into more detail on that.

#### Interacting with Paper on the Digital Desk

I was extra surprised that the DiamondTouch paper did not cite this paper! (I assume it's because online search wasn't a thing in 2001 so it was difficult to become familiar with work you didn't have some kind of connection to). In this paper, the example applications came first, which helped me understand the tech, before the tech was described. This style of paper really works for me, since I have some bigger context in which to understand the interactions before I dig into the details of the technology. 

The author gives some reasons for why paper hasn't disappeared: are these the real reasons? How about just laziness, or difficulty/cost in digitizing? Hospitals in particular could majorly benefit (lowered cost in storage, easier to transfer to a new doctor, less terrible handwriting to decode, etc), but there are MAJOR downsides to digitizing: digital medical records have been held ransom by hackers who want money in exchange for unlocking their digital systems. The new voting systems have turned out to be more vulnerable to hacking than previous, paper-based systems. These are important downsides to paper-based systems that it's worth considering. 

There are also downsides to interacting with paper: paper-cuts, smudges, spills, etc. I do want a world where the digital and physical are seamlessly combined, as Pierre Wellner does, and I do love his philosophical motivation.

#### Social Immersive Media: Pursuing Best Practices for Multi-user Interactive Camera/projector Exhibits

"Our work abandons GUI metaphors and builds on the language of cinema, casting users as actors within simulated narrative
models." I appreciate this attempt to redefine the metaphors we design with! I do question: Why cinema? Why not dance or another socially immersive experience? I think there's room to expand here. Having access to the Exploratorium since 2007, and the excellent Denver Children's Museum since 1990, I probably dont' fully appreciate the focus on experiential, social museum experiences in this paper (but I do love it!). It doesn't seem novel (though I also find myself pushing back on any requirement of novelty for papers these days - why is that so important?). I love this extensive context/related work section! Instead of simply listing papers, the authors went into a deal of detail describing many of them briefly. It's helpful for getting a little introduction to the field, and I will try to do this in my future papers. I resonate with this paper's goal of "abandoning language"! I hope to use this in my own work. These are some of the most useful design guidelines I've seen in papers thus far: clear, immediately actionable, and useful.  They way they immediately gave examples of their design guidelines in action also helped me wrap my head around what they meant (another aspect of paper-writing I plan to emulate).

In general, this is the most philosophical of the three, and that is probably why I like it the most. I do question their metrics for measuring the experiences. THey seem to assume their designs have the intended experience, but I'd like to see that captured a bit more. Perhaps they go into more detail in another paper: but this is an important challenge, especially for such new and weird work. I'm even more surprised they converged on the "cinema" metaphor rather than the theatre or performing arts one after reading their projects. Even near the end of the paper they are still introducing new philosophers! This is definitely a paper I'll re-read.

Projector-based (limited lighting conditions)
How does it know who is interacting? What if someone has only one arm? Does it work for black people?
Did they come up w/ this list of requirements before or after developing their thing? (I bet a little of both). Also everyone does this, am I really gonna throw a fit about it?

OH SHIT it generates a different electrical signal to the part of the table they wish to touch, that's awesome. Wow talk about human in the loop. Don't just read a signal, generate a signal, pipe it through the user, and read that signal back...so cool.

It can't tell where on the antenna a person is touching, so thte size of the antennas determines the size you're able to track? OH DANG their pixels are super small:  "a typical finger touch would span at least two rows and two columns." 

Leverages social norms of touching - this is a cool way to use that, but also limits the tech from being culturally universal (is any tech actually culturally universal?). Also awesome to exploit it!! Will they talk about the social dynamics afforded by an interfaces that can actually use touching? How many people "deep" can it sense? 

Discussion of objects that could be interactive: appreciate this "reach across the aisle"

Sorry what??
"Our prototype was made from a fiberglass laminate called GML1000 [9], whose thermal properties allowed us to operate the table temporarily (and without damage) while it was covered with burning alcohol."

Related work later...interesting choice...can't decide how I feel.

Software defined personal workspaces. Good focus on actual advantages of digital aspect.

This seems like it was a tool built for another purpose, then redirected into a paper. Smart!

Reasons for why paper hasn't disappeared: are these the real reasons? How about just laziness, or difficulty/cost in digitizing? (hospitals) plus major downsides of digitizing: hospitals being held ransom for unlocking their digital systems.

Goofy graphics.

**FORMATTING:**
Example applications came first, which helped me understand the tech, before the tech was described.

Fingertapping seems pretty sketchy. 

DynamicLand!!!

Love the discussion of different techniques, including those that didn't work. Deep appreciation of this transparency. 

Funny:

"Our work abandons GUI metaphors and builds on the language of cinema, casting users as actors within simulated narrative
models."
Finally! Though: Why cinema? Why not dance or another socially immersive experience?

#### General
What use-cases do they describe, which are more compelling?
DiamondTouch doesn't cite Wellner!! Why not?
Wellner: paper is good, let's keep it. DiamondTouch: no discussion of paper advantages? 

Philosophical differences:
"The purpose of the DigitalDesk is not to convert paper into electronic documents; it is to support rapid and direct computer based interaction with selected regions of paper documents." DiamondTouch doesn't really seem to have a philosophical vision.

Wellner: here are some limitations. DiamondTouch: fuck you we're perfect.

Focus on unencumbered: DiamondTouch and Social Immersive.
