When I was a kid, none of the “future engineer” stereotypes applied to me. I had no interest in mainstream “engineering” toys; the last thing I wanted was to sit down and follow pages of step-by-step instructions to build a robot or car that someone else designed. I hated math and found science generally frustrating. Eventually, I dropped out of college to train and work as a clown and puppeteer in my early 20s. 

After graduating from the Clown Conservatory, I joined Liebe Wetzel’s puppeteering group Lunatique Fantastique. We performed Bunraku-style found-object puppetry, where three or more puppeteers manipulate a single puppet made out of inanimate objects like a napkin or a Japanese tea set. Together with my fellow performers, I learned how to imbue soft materials with lifelike kinesthetic qualities in order to tell complex, emotionally powerful stories. Our shows had people laughing at plastic bag chickens and crying the moment a napkin got tied into a knot. By using familiar objects in new and magical ways, we _____ transcended barriers to build direct connections with the audience.

Today I'm a 2nd-year PhD student studying Human Computer Interaction in Eric Paulos' Hybrid Ecologies Lab at UC Berkeley, and I'm still working on ways to bring objects to life. Using digital fabrication techniques, we're developing new ways to embed technology into textiles and other materials.

Why do we want to do this. Technology permeates almost every aspect of our lives nowadays, and all trends indicate it's only going to increase. In fact, worldwide demand for wearable medical devices is projected to exceed $4.4 billion by the year 2020. All that technology needs integrate into our lives - it needs to go beyond function. We need to focus on creating technology that supports every aspect of our lives: our emotional well-being, our spirituality, our social connections, and our mental and physical health. 

TRANSITION. Just like how the puppeteers would connect with audiences using familiar materials in new and magical ways, we're ______________

Together with  my fellow researcher Christine Dierk, I recently coauthored a project about battery-free bistable wearable displays where we created custom circuitry that allows us to integrate wirelessly-powered, non-emissive e-ink displays into garments and other form factors like fingernails. There's no battery, so there's nothing for you to remember to charge or care for: this technology is there when you want it, for presonal or public displays, and disappears into the background the rest of the time. By strategic placement of wireless power, we're even able to continuosly animate these e-ink displays for playful, subtle, and engaging interactions. 

We also just had a paper accepted to the Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction conference for our work on hair as interactive material. We braided shape memory alloy into hair, and hooked it up to a capacitive touch circuit so we have both input and output. By using familiar materials in unusual ways, we're able to explore new forms of computational interaction from private, semi-public, and spectacular interfaces. 

My more recent work focuses on gestural fabrics that leverage the surprisingly playful properties of motion and magnetism to expand the landscape of interactive wearables. I've embedded magnetic hematite beads and custom copper coils onto a wide range of clothing to enable new expressive and tactile wearable experiences.


CONCLUSION



TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE GET WHEN DOING THIS. WHY.
- support for health, comprehensive person, outreach to different kinds of people, enable new kinds of expression. Probably ref Lullaby Project related work.




What I didn't understand for a long time was the idea that creativity and engineering are connected. After a friend talked me into taking my first computer science class as an undergrad, I discovered that it was just like solving puzzles, which I loved. Looking back, it’s obvious that solving puzzles — which is all about finding creative ways to answer open-ended questions — is a lot of what Computer Science is. It's not strange to think that I ended up as a computer engineer. It’s strange that I missed that path for so many years.

When it comes to health and well-being 

These days there are many different ways to engage w/ technology, but why do kids get all the fun stuff? New forms of computation are important for more reasons than just engaging kids in STEM. What I imagine is a new landscape of wearable technologies that celebrates diversity across gender, race, and body types and empowers individuals with a more personal, playful, performative, and meaningful "technique of dress". 

How many of you carry your phone with you every day? How many personalize it?
