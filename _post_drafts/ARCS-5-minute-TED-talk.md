When I was a kid, none of the “future engineer” stereotypes applied to me. I had no interest in mainstream “engineering” toys; the last thing I wanted was to sit down and follow pages of step-by-step instructions to build a robot or car that someone else designed. I hated math and found science generally frustrating. Eventually, I dropped out of college to train and work as a clown in my early 20s.

What I didn't understand for a long time was the idea that creativity and engineering are connected. A friend talked me into taking my first computer science class as an undergrad by explaining to me that it was just like solving puzzles, which he knew I loved. Looking back, it’s obvious that solving puzzles — which is all about finding creative ways to answer open-ended questions — is a lot of what Computer Science is. It's not strange to think that I ended up as an engineer. It’s strange that I missed that path for so many years.

These days there are many different ways to engage w/ technology, but why do kids get all the fun stuff? New forms of computation are important for more reasons than just engaging kids in STEM. What I imagine is a new landscape of wearable technologies that celebrates diversity across gender, race, and body types and empowers individuals with a more personal, playful, performative, and meaningful "technique of dress". 

How many of you carry your phone with you every day? How many personalize it?
