Pick two different technologies (e.g. web site, app, vending machine -- any technology with an interface), based on these criteria:

familiar: one that you have used many times in the past
unfamiliar: one that you are using for the first time
Identify at least 3 measurements you would use to determine how usable each technology is.

For the length of a transaction (or 15 minutes of use, whichever is less), notice and record your experience. Pay attention to:

- instances in which you had to modify your own activity for the system;
- moments of confusion or uncertainty;
- inconveniences, instances requiring added physical or mental effort;
- emotional reactions (annoyance, anger, fear, delight, happiness);
- times when everything went smoothly, without problems.

Summarize your observations with each technology in under 2 pages total, and discuss whether each measurement you identified earlier would be sufficient to determine usability. Then write up to 1 additional page reflecting on what you learned about usability, and what it was like to think about usability while doing these activities.

(Total: UNDER 3 double-spaced pages.) Feel free to include photos, screenshots, or other visual aids in an appendix at the end, after your write-up.

**Measures**
- **Time to task completion.** This should also include some measure of how complex the task is, and how frequently this task would be completed in regular use of the application.
- **Frustration levels.** For these types of interfaces (task-oriented, not a game), this should be zero.
- **Total clicks to task completion.** I'm including this because I don't have intuition about the difference between total clicks and time to completion: I could imagine an interface where a user only clicks once, but it took them ~8 minutes to decide where to click. But I could also imagine an application that involves more clicks but each one is confident and gets the job done correctly and quickly. (I would still think fewer clicks would probably be better, but perhaps for a specialized application it would make sense).

### Familiar

### Unfamiliar
The EdgeX interface for an online class. EdgeX is a system to support Massively Open Online Courses, so it's designed to be experienced primarily online. I'm using it for a class here on campus, but still mostly engage with it online. It's basically another Bcourses that this professor prefers because he regularly runs MOOCs. I've used it before, many years ago, but have no memory (and the interface has likely changed since then anyway). I have used it regularly so far this semester.

#### Summary of task 

- Log in.
- Look at assignments for this week. Figure out what is due, the reading assignments, and prepare for the lecture topic.

#### Inherent complexity of task 

- Logging in is a common and familiar action, so this should go very quickly. Even if I have to "sign up" using it for the first time, it should still go quickly and be familiar.
- Because this app is designed to support online coursework, I expect that checking assignments should also be very straightforward. That's one of the main things I expect people to do with an app like this, so it should be very easy and fast. It may take a minute or two to become familiar with the interface, but I expect the information I need to be readily available perhaps even in different formats (calendar, list, syllabus, etc). There may be a lot of information, but I would still expect a relatively straightforward interface. This course isn't unusual in any way, so I would not expect any "unique" requirements.

#### Results
**Logging in:** this did indeed go quickly. It appears I have an account from many years ago (possibly from before I was an undergrad!). I didn't remember that, but my browser did, so my old password worked immediately. This was basically effortless.

**Look at assignments for this week:** After 15 minutes, I still have not succeeded at this task. Or maybe I have but didn't realize it! It's unclear! I feel immensely frustrated, stressed out, and I have absolutely no sense of how much work I have to do before the next class on Monday. I feel like I clicked around the entire syllabus, and most of the EdX website without successfully completing my task. I also don't feel more familiar with the interface than before: it's still just as frustrating and hard to use.

List of issues:

- **Missing information.** There are no dates attached to the assignments (see main interface pic). Each class is labeled with a title, but I really need to know what is due when. The interface doesn't seem optimized for following a specific schedule. This might make sense for a MOOC, which can often be done "at your own pace" but it's frustrating for use in this class, when the deadlines actually do matter. There is also no calendar view for me to see a high-level overview of what will happen when.
- **Site navigation issues.** I can proceed through the course, which is done by clicking on the blue header of each subsection (see course details picture). While this does show a breadcrumb header, so I have some sense of where I am, the other icons on the page are very unhelpful. See the little book icons along the top. One of those sections is about important, time-sensitive tasks all new GSIs need to complete. Can you guess which one?
- **Automatic continuation doesn't match mental model.** When clicking through the assignments, trying to see what is due for a given week, the user is automatically dumped into the next week's assignments with no warning or indication. The breadcrumb path changes, but it's a subtle change that happens after the screen reloads (aka, the equivalent of a blink), which makes it very difficult to notice the change. Instead, the emotional sense is that the number of assignments for this week is endless: in fact I didn't realize I had left the first week until I got to the end of the semester. This contributed to the sense of stress.
- **Confusing, sometimes conflicing information.** This may have more to do with the way the instructors set up the course. There is an assignment due on Feb. 1 that is only accessible from the completed assignment page of the week labeled "First day of class". There is no other reference to it on any of the other pages, and all other assignments are due on Monday before class. I'm not sure if this assignment is an error, or if we really have something due today. Also, the week labeled "First day of class" is the only one that has a "Homework this week" section. Some sections have a "pre-work due before this section" subheading, but others don't. In order to see what is due each week, I need to click through every single page of every single subsection for a given week.

I thought Bcoursese was bad, but this is truly awful.

**Measures**
- Time to task completion: > 15 minutes is a clear failure.
- Frustration levels: very high, this is a clear failure.
- Total clicks: I have clicked on almost every thing it's possible to click on, multiple times. Clear failure.

I'd say these measures do indeed capture how unusable this system is.
