Pick two different technologies (e.g. web site, app, vending machine -- any technology with an interface), based on these criteria:

familiar: one that you have used many times in the past
unfamiliar: one that you are using for the first time
Identify at least 3 measurements you would use to determine how usable each technology is.

For the length of a transaction (or 15 minutes of use, whichever is less), notice and record your experience. Pay attention to:

- instances in which you had to modify your own activity for the system;
- moments of confusion or uncertainty;
- inconveniences, instances requiring added physical or mental effort;
- emotional reactions (annoyance, anger, fear, delight, happiness);
- times when everything went smoothly, without problems.

Summarize your observations with each technology in under 2 pages total, and discuss whether each measurement you identified earlier would be sufficient to determine usability. Then write up to 1 additional page reflecting on what you learned about usability, and what it was like to think about usability while doing these activities.

(Total: UNDER 3 double-spaced pages.) Feel free to include photos, screenshots, or other visual aids in an appendix at the end, after your write-up.

The EdgeX interface for an online class. EdgeX is a system to support Massively Open Online Courses, so it's designed to be experienced primarily online. I'm using it for a class here on campus, but still mostly engage with it online. It's basically another Bcourses that this professor prefers because he regularly runs MOOCs.
