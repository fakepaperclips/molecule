1. Disaster camping in Tahoe: https://jhorna.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/camping/
2. Getting lost camping w/ David, ending up at the Buddhist Retreat Center 22 miles down a rough dirt road, nearly out of gas. Had the TomTom GPS but the UI is so bad we couldn't use it / didn't trust it.
3. In Dwinelle, looking for Gail's office the 2nd time.
