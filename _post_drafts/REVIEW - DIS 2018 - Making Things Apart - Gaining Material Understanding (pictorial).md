## The detailed review
Write your review of the pictorial here. Please identify positive and negatives of the work and the pictorial, plus any suggestions for revisions.

- typos / problems with english. Unclear phrasings (hebocon contestant: make it more clear this is a robot)
- first image completely unclear and a little creepy. Very shallow depth of focus and lacking context makes it very difficult to see what the image is.
- Unclear on whether 4 stages are new, or are from Uncrafting? P3 especially confusing.
- Instead of drawing a counter-clockwise arrow, why not arrange the pictures in a more reasonable way?
- Typo/missing info: pg. 6 "The hebocon battlefield and audience during festival XX" should prob specify what XX stands for.
- Workshop 4: what is an "architecture"?
- Typo, pg. 8 in heading "Material Ressources"

- What's the advantage gained by takign things apart rather than cutting out of cardboard?
- I want more text and fewer pictures actually!
