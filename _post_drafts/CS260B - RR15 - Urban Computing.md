###  Urban probes: encountering our emerging urban atmospheres.

### Cultural mobilities: Diversity and agency in urban computing.

According to Wikipedia, Eric Paulos coined the term "Urban Computing". That means, in some sense, Dourish is criticizing Paulos pretty directly! In another way, he's criticizing the types of work done in the field "urban computing" (UC), but I am very curious to hear from Eric what it's like getting this kind of critique of his work.

A trend in Eric's papers we've read so far is to do some kind of cultural probe, extract insights, and use those to develop an annotated design artifact. There's no user study, because that's not the point: the point isn't a singular piece of technology that may or may not have the intended effect, the point seems to be capturing insights in an instantiated object. As a way to introduce new fields, and shift the conversation of technology I find this much more appealing than attempts to claim that a given new piece of tech will have the effect we want. Honestly, how many papers have we seen that HAVE user studies (even very successful ones!) but the tech hasn't seem to go anywhere? Whereas the description of "urban computing" immediately sparks ideas and concepts to me: it's generative.

And part of what it generated was this intense and excellent critique by Dourish and others. How is Dourish able to so frequently hone in on potential areas to improve? And how is he able to write critiques that themselves generate entire new topologies of thought??? This paper also acts as an awesome resource for citing work done in UC. The final sections, where he details examples of how the term "mobile computing" glosses over important details is utterly compelling and inspiring. (Also, technically Eric's paper called for "a discussion" and that's exactly what Dourish is providing! Excellent!!). Dourish's work is certainly a paper I'll find myself reading again and again.

I'm very curious to hear Eric's perspective on both these papers, their place in HCI, and their impact on the field!

Side note: it's funny to me for some reason that both papers reference Guy Debord and the Situationists.
