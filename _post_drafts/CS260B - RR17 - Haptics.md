### shiftIO: Reconfigurable Tactile Elements for Dynamic Affordances and Mobile Interaction.
I LOVE this paper. The idea is so cool, and the implementation seems like something that could actually become a real product in the real world in like, 3 months. Things I love about this project: how weird it is! The tiny actuators! Using flexible electronics! The design of a haptic interface that I could actually imagine using right now! Focus on low power! Attempt at using electropermanent magnets! I'm not even sure I find their applications that compelling, but that's because I didn't need to: I'm already on board! I can't eevn fully articulate why, I just love this! I think it's partly because the movement of the little magnets is so cute in the video! 

But this is one of those papers that makes me regret the fact that academia doesn't reward making your work actually reproducible. Why didn't they release their circuit diagram files? Also, you'll notice if you try to reproduce this that they don't actually provide all the information you might need to reproduce it, despite all the numbers they include. (I have tried to reproduce this as a first step towards another project in case you were wondering).

This is such a cool example of a real world instantiation of Ishii's "Tangible Bits" imagined world. I can't articulate why I want this world, I just do! And this paper makes me happy because of how clearly it represents that world. (I do wonder how Prof Follmer will distinguish his research vision from Ishii).


### Haptic Retargeting: Dynamic Repurposing of Passive Haptics for Enhanced Virtual Reality Experiences.

I should admit off the bat that I'm inclined to be biased against VR. I'm trying to be reasonable below, but my bias is definitely showing.

#### Long-term effects
What would be the long-term effects of a system that messes with one's proprioception in this way? Our body-mind connection isn't static, it changes in response to how we train it. Might the remapping/warping of the way our body understands how we move through space result in decreased proprioceptive abilities? I feel like this is an extreme version of Google Maps (which already decimated my navigation abilities) and I'd worry about its effects on people. 

#### Limited body awareness
I wonder what would happen if you put dancers or mimes into this system: they tend to be much more bodily aware than the average person, and I would be interested to see if they were more aware of the discrepancy. In particular, I wonder if people in this study actually DID notice the discrepancy, but didn't necessarily know how to talk about it. The quotes at the end made it seem like people did notice something was up, but didn't know exaclty what. Especially this one: "this is surreal; it's definitely messing with me". Was that said during the study, or afterwards? It's uncelear, and if it was during the study it seems like a clear indication 

#### Evaluation section
I LOVE that they put exact example questions from their survey in the body of the paper! It really helps to ground what they're talking about, and saves me from going to look up the details of the survey they used. The diagram was terrible, however: what do the stars mean? What do the little backwards-c shapes above the bars mean? I can't get a clear idea of their findings from the chart, I have to read the description to see which comparisons were statistically significant. Also it seemed that people only preferred the Hybrid case against the wand? This doesn't really seem to suppor their later suggestion to always use the Hybrid approach.

Having said all that, IF you accept the idea of VR as cool (a big IF) (jk) (kind of) then this is a super cool way to manipulate people into experiencing the world in interesting ways. Very clever way of messing with the fundamental way we interact with the world and a very clever way to undermine our very existence in space.
