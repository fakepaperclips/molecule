1. First cut between dramatic hair changes
  - I'd add an extra second to the pause before the hair all drops? Specifically: take a second off unwinding, add a second before it drops.
2. When / how to transition from DB putting hair up to phone shots.
  - I really like the shorter soldering thing; what does it look like if we go hair->phone->soldering?  Is that too jumpy?  I think it would be good to have the phone right after the hair goes up -- or split the screen there to be phone on desk + hair --> do not disturb setting + hair, then transition to soldering? 
3. Shorten clip of Christie leaving office?
  - yes, shorten christie leaving (don't need to walk up to door maybe?)  and lengthen her first interaction with Kevin -- he's barely there before we cut, and it's hard to parse the sudden change
4. Throw focus between Christie getting notification from Cesar and Cesar texting?
  - I think those cuts work well, but we def need to call out the texts -- I didn't even notice the HairIO text being sent until the like 5th time watching this
5. Christie asking for directions - too long hold? Too short? Other ways to call out the text message contents?
  - I think the sequence is good -- if we need to cut, maybe shorten the time on the text message.  I'm thinking overall for texts that we put a callout caption box on the top of the screen?
  - Cut Christie long walking a bit more.
6. Transition to concert? Do we need a title card or something there to say what it is? Maybe zoom in on a sign announcing the performance?
  - I do think we need a transition there.  Either a sign or the narrator explaining, or a scene of maybe Cesar redoing her hair into the performance style?
7. Fave concert shots.
  - Too much lead-in to part of concert where the hair is moving
  - cut entering through door?
  - concert can be shorter
  - movement shot from the back and first drama shot of it up from the front.  Maybe we can clip those a little shorter though.
8. Anything else!!!!!
  - Add overlay over Advaita to indicate that it's sped up.
  - I'm still not sure how to fit advaita in there; maybe she's taking down Christie's concert hair?  Or they're talking about the concert?
  - Title cards? Captions? Voice over?
  - Title cards: label narratives

_________________________________________________________________________
1. It would be nice if "Dramatic style change" appeared at the exact same time the video cuts
2. Final version should have correct dots (over the a and the O)
3. "Capacitive Touch" title card seems weird. All of the other ones are named after the use cases and not the underlying mechanism (i.e. style change as notification). Maybe something like "Subtle Interaction as Input"? I don't love it, but I think it's better. Whatever we title this should mirror the "Style Change as Input" that we used for DB soldering.
4. Split screen should end at the same time (me & Kevin split with phone)
5. Split screen with Cesar texting and Lo-fi AR should be opposite (i.e. me on left, cesar on right). Better mirrors previous split screens, also the phone is already on the right side of the screen, so I think it will transition better.
6. I don't think we should actually call it Lo-Fi AR. I like calling it that in-house, but I don't think we want to put ourselves in the realm of AR (and we don't actually call it that in the paper). Borrowing language from the paper, I suggest "Spatiotemporal Cues" or "hands-free navigation"
7. "Dramatic Style Change" Should probably be changed to "Public Display" or something to do with performativity (since in the paper we define that as something distinct from style change. This title could also show up earlier (once the hair is just beginning to move)
8. Again, mirroring the paper "Social Interactions" --> "Social Engagement"
9. Location of "Social Interactions" is kind of strange. I like the idea of having them in a uniform location (bottom left corner unless split screen)
10. I don't think "Social Interactions" has to disappear/reappear for actuation, but I like the way the subtext changes. Can we leave "Social Interactions" up but then just fade the subtext out and then back in?
11. I feel like we need something better to end on, though I'm not sure what. probably a title card (Title, our names, institutions, etc, but it'd be nice if it had some generic HairIO thing in the background). Perhaps the shot of the different braids actuating in the box?
12. Is there a time limit? We should check this.


1. Opinions on font/style/color/locations?
  - Christie:  No opinions. Ask Cesar?
2. Suggestions for text?
  - Christie:  No opinions. Ask Cesar?
3. Christie getting text from Cesar while talking w/ Kevin scene: Is there too much going on? I'm worried it's a lot to read / take in. Timing ideas? I think I could also pause the video to highlight something but it might look weird. Could also have less text, or text with a different timing.
  - C: I don't think it's too much going on, but at the same time I kind of know what to expect. Maybe we can get an undergrad or someone to preview it and see if they know what's happening?
4. Concert still too long?
  - C: I think it's an okay length for now. If we need the video to be shorter, we can definitely regain some time here. But otherwise I think it's fine for now.
5. Need transition to concert?
  - C: A short transition might be nice. Maybe just Cesar giving me a pink strand of hair? (like as a good luck thing, and then the audience can just ~ assume ~ that I tied it in my hair myself)
6. Opening shot: old footage in photo booth? (Where is that?) For that I'm planning to freeze it, and label everything for a few seconds to get tech info in there.

7. Transition to Advaita?
  - C:  Not sure what it should be, but agree that we need it. Or at least some break from the previous narrative. We could just add some sort of title card or tech details here?
