1. First cut between dramatic hair changes
  - I'd add an extra second to the pause before the hair all drops? Specifically: take a second off unwinding, add a second before it drops.
2. When / how to transition from DB putting hair up to phone shots.
  - I really like the shorter soldering thing; what does it look like if we go hair->phone->soldering?  Is that too jumpy?  I think it would be good to have the phone right after the hair goes up -- or split the screen there to be phone on desk + hair --> do not disturb setting + hair, then transition to soldering? 
3. Shorten clip of Christie leaving office?
  - yes, shorten christie leaving (don't need to walk up to door maybe?)  and lengthen her first interaction with Kevin -- he's barely there before we cut, and it's hard to parse the sudden change
4. Throw focus between Christie getting notification from Cesar and Cesar texting?
  - I think those cuts work well, but we def need to call out the texts -- I didn't even notice the HairIO text being sent until the like 5th time watching this
5. Christie asking for directions - too long hold? Too short? Other ways to call out the text message contents?
  - I think the sequence is good -- if we need to cut, maybe shorten the time on the text message.  I'm thinking overall for texts that we put a callout caption box on the top of the screen?
  - Cut Christie long walking a bit more.
6. Transition to concert? Do we need a title card or something there to say what it is? Maybe zoom in on a sign announcing the performance?
  - I do think we need a transition there.  Either a sign or the narrator explaining, or a scene of maybe Cesar redoing her hair into the performance style?
7. Fave concert shots.
  - Too much lead-in to part of concert where the hair is moving
  - cut entering through door?
  - concert can be shorter
  - movement shot from the back and first drama shot of it up from the front.  Maybe we can clip those a little shorter though.
8. Anything else!!!!!
  - Add overlay over Advaita to indicate that it's sped up.
  - I'm still not sure how to fit advaita in there; maybe she's taking down Christie's concert hair?  Or they're talking about the concert?
  - Title cards? Captions? Voice over?
  - Title cards: label narratives
