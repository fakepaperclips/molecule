For some reason, when you google "useful phrases in Swedish" you get phrases like "I love you" or "Do you come here often." And when you start a basic course in Swedish (like the excellent DuoLingo), you learn random stuff like "The elephants are running away" or "I don't eat turtles."

Here's my collection of *actually* useful Swedish phrases:

| Swedish        | English      | Notes |
| :------------- |:-------------| :---- |
| Hej.            | Hello.        | Everyone said this to me rather than Hallå. Much less formal than the Czech Republic! |
| Ursäkta.        | Excuse me.    | Very useful on the metro, especially when you're lugging large bags from the airport. Good for "getting someone's attention".[4](https://studentblogski.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/some-useful-swedish-wordsphrases-for-new-comers-to-sweden/) |
| Förlåt.         | Sorry.      | Good after you bump into someone on the metro.  |
| Tack så mycket. | Thank you very much. | I got lots of smiles whenever I said this. |
| Varsågod. | You're welcome. | (So you understand when someone replies back after you say "thank you." |
| Snälla. | Please. | |
| Jag förstår inte. | I don't understand. | Our friend who looks Swedish needed to learn this one right away. |
| Talar du engelska? | Do you speak English? | The answer is always yes, but I thought it was nice to ask. |
| Det går så bra. | That's all right. | Hasn't come in useful yet but I hold out hope. |
| Jag skulle vilja köpa det här. | I would like to buy this. | Said while pointing at something. |
