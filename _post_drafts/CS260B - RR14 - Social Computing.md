### The familiar stranger: anxiety, comfort, and play in public places.
Eric Paulos and Elizabeth Goodman. 2004. The familiar stranger: anxiety, comfort, and play in public places. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems(CHI '04). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 223-230. DOI= http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/985692.985721

#### Role of technology
Both papers are addressing the role technology can and does play in our lives. The papers I am particularly drawn to almost treat the technology as an afterthought. The Jabberwocky, Sotto Voce: both centered the experience, and only used the technology in so far as it supported that experience. In both cases, the discussion of the technology feels so natural and relevant, rather than tacked on imagined use cases that happens in some papers to justify new technology. Whether or not it actually evolved that way, the Jabberwocky at least feels like the idea came first, tech second (having said that I do love papers that introduce new tech and go through a list of use-cases...I just like this better!). The FB paper of course is examining existing technology, and I appreciate the focus on the role seemingly "technical" decisions play in our lives (e.g., "feed prioritization"). I appreciate the kinds of data researchers have access to through FB and their APIs, and I'm glad people are looking at the role these interfaces actually play in our lives.

#### Supporting flexible goals

The FB paper includes these remarkable sentences:
```
Table 2 shows that as ego broadcasts more, she reports growing less close 
to any given alter; roughly one additional status update per month is 
associated with a 0.02 decline in tie strength (p = 0.03). Similarly, the 
more that alter broadcasts (but that ego does not necessarily read), ego 
reports growing less close (Î² = -0.03, p < 0.001).
```

Later the authors talk about the importance of feed prioritization. They emphasize the importance of broadcast messages getting to the right people or "they have little value" but I think it's more than that! Broadcasts that get no responses seem to actively harm our social ties (though of course this is tough to actually measure quantitatively, and the effect wasn't huge)! Regardless, users of FB are given no insight into how the "feed prioritization works", and early on were subjected to FB's notion of "open world" privacy. FB did eventually give people some tools to manage what they see (possibly because of this research?). For example, the ability to "unfollow" someone so you remain friends but don't see their posts, and the ability to get notified everytime someone posts, as well as a variety of privacy settings. I have found that I can manipulate whose posts I see by purposefully searching out their page a few days in a row, which is a fascinating way to manipulate my own social fabric. I wonder how many people do this. (I also studiously avoided visiting my college crush's pages out of fear that FB would somehow reveal my repeated visits to his page...did that limitation actually bring us closer together?)

The two scenarios in the Jabberwocky project started out by identifying a range of experiences to support. I would be curious to see what a user study with the Jabberwocky would have found! Did it actually support both escaping familiarity and seeking it?

#### Evolving concerns about privacy
In "familiar stranger", the concerns about random strangers being able to access data about an individual vividly contrast with the lack of privacy discussion in "growing closer". In fact, the word "privacy" appears only once in the FB paper, and four times in "familiar stranger". I expected both to address privacy concerns since many aspects of social behavior ar (or traditionally have been) private. A first interpretation might be that that social norms have evolved and we are much more tolerant of privacy violations than before, given how much we voluntarily share on social media. But, I suspect we're just not as aware of when our privacy might be violated (and if we were made aware, we would be just as concerned). Also, I question their definition of "one-to-one" direct communication: even wall posts on FB are public, and I suspect this changed how and what people chose to post.

This kind of long-term societal shift in values, norms and expectations has always been very interesting to me, and I hope all the data we're currently gathering will support longer tracking systems of changing cultural norms (as we can see trends in weather thanks to data-capturing systems that began back in the 1800s, even if their data collection isn't as good as modern methods). Especially recalling one of our earliest papers, where the authors noted that decision-making processes were disrupted by the computer...in what ways are our decision-making processes being consistently affected in ways we no longer recognize? What is now just "water"?

#### Format and writing style
Both papers are beautifully written. Clear, with good use of formatting and bolding. I do wish the FB paper had done a better job of using bolded subheadings to communicate findings, rather than just categorize a section. For instance, they repeated this pattern a few times:

**General headline that doesn't tell you anything**
```
Reminder of hypothesis, and statement that we had wondered whether this was true. It is. 
```

I appreciate the repetition of the hypothesis, but why not put the conclusion in the sub-heading? Something like: passive consumption and broadcasting increases tie strength. It makes it easier to read through the paper quickly, getting high-level findings fast, and then moving on to detailed reading where it's important. I also suspect this type of heading actually supports memory (though I wonder if anyone's studied it).

In the stranger paper, the two scenarios are interesting, relatable, and compelling. By introducing them so early on in the paper, my understanding of the project was immediately given context, and grounded in these specific examples (Pierre Wellner's "Paper on the Digital Desk" also put the scenarios first, and I find I prefer this technique to introducing technology first). The examples are also mirror images of each other: one person seeking familiarity, the other eschewing it.

I'm not familiar with most of the "theory" references, however, and I wish the authors had added a few more sentences to introduce the concepts rather than quick name-drops. For example: "For Bauman, society can only define itself against its strangers". Who is Bauman? What field is this coming from? A bit more context could have improved the readability of these interjections.
