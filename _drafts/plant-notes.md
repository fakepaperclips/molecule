#### Mandarin Semi-Dwarf Clementine
1. Roots sensitive to too much water, so don't use potting mixes that retain water. Best may be rose garden soil mixes (formulated for outside use).[1]
2. Water about once per week. Only water if soil is dry ~2 inches down into soil. Yellow or cupped leaves may be overwatered. Citrus prefer infrequent, deep watering to frequent, shallow sprinklings.
3. Potting instructions[1]. In a container, water deeply once or twice a week [3].
4. Need full sun, 8 hours / day.
5. After first year, add citrus fertilizer (slow-release) in the Spring.
6. Pruning is fine except in winter. Well-pruned trees have higher fruit output and are less prone to branch breakage [1].
7. Citrus Problem Solver.[2]
