### Motivation
I enjoy making things for my own sake, but I also enjoy making things that help
other people make things, and understand what they are making. I am concerned
with both the context of how makers get to make, and exactly *who* gets to
make. I want to invent tools that address issues in current processes while
maintaining awareness of my situated position and perspective inside this
domain. Broadly speaking, I am motivated by a shift from consumerism to
creator-centric exploration (*creationism*, if you will) and the so-called
[democratization of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_technology).

### Personal

Hi Mom! I was born and raised in sunny eastern Long Island, NY. I enjoy playing
guitar, running, bouldering, and home-brewing beer. In Rochester, my favorite
diner was James Brown's Place (I miss it dearly), and I never ate a garbage
plate. When it wasn't snowing, I could often be found on the Genesee River
pushing water around (and, sometimes when it was snowing). Since moving to
California, I've been biking more actively, playing on Cal's club ultimate
frisbee team, [Thugmo](http://www.ugmo.org/thugmo), and eating burritos at a
fairly considerable frequency (just consider).
