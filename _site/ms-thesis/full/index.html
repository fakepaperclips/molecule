<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>This thesis analyzes perceptions towards collaborating with version control and
introduces a new system, CodePilot, for project-wide synchronous collaborative
programming backed by version control. We review our study of programmers using
the system to collaborate on web development tasks, and suggest that combining
synchronous collaborative programming with version control as asynchronous
collaboration is a novel, powerful paradigm in programmer collaboration. It not
only makes version control more accessible for novice programmers, but prompts
more experienced programmers to coordinate and parallelize their development
efforts.</p>

<h1 id="cha:intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>Software development is becoming more collaborative, popularized by
GitHub and the open source movement. CodePilot is a web integrated
development environment (IDE) which combines synchronous and
asynchronous collaboration. It does this by allowing users to import any
public repository of code from GitHub into CodePilot, where it syncs the
state of the project across multiple users in real-time. It does this in
a fashion similar to that of Google Docs or other real-time online
editors. However, CodePilot is not only limited to a single buffer of
text and supports syncing changes across many files simultaneously.
Collaborators can see each other’s edits as they type, and when they are
satisfied with their changes, they can review, commit, and push their
code back to GitHub, allowing that work to be shared with users outside
of CodePilot.</p>

<h2 id="software-collaboration">Software Collaboration</h2>

<p>There are two main modes of synchronization in collaboration: real-time
and non-real-time. Real-time synchronization usually applies operational
transform syncing to maintain a persistent single state of a document as
changes come in from multiple sources <span class="citation">Fraser
(2009)</span>. This is the technology that supports Google Docs and
Spreadsheets - all edits are seen in real time. There are also
non-real-time collaboration systems, such as distributed version
control. In this model, multiple copies of the same codebase are allowed
to exist in different states, and periodically update themselves from
each other. Commonly there is still a centralized repository host (such
as GitHub), and teams will use branches to split changes, or break the
codebase into different relevant repositories if the complexity deems it
necessary.</p>

<p>Coding with others cohesively is hard. This difficulty generally grows
when distributed version control is used, since more people can program
together using version control when compared to traditional pair
programming. While version control is widely hailed as a useful and
perhaps even indispensable tool, dealing with merge conflicts can impede
a novice programmer’s collaboration efforts from being effective. This
often leads to frustration and an initial distaste for version control.
The budding programmer now must not only must learn the core computer
science fundamentals, but become proficient with this new and unfamiliar
system.</p>

<p>Compare this to collaboration with Google Docs: powerful real-time
syncing mechanisms allow users to work on the same document and see each
others changes as they happen. This feature is heralded as
revolutionizing document collaboration and often credited for allowing
Google to weaken the stranglehold that Microsoft Office previously had
on the document editing market. This isn’t to say that real-time editors
will solve all our problems, but it does suggest that other effective
modes of collaboration lie in the range between the two extremes we have
found ourselves with.</p>

<p>Asynchronous version control (such as git or mercurial) provides a
concise, discrete history of the changes that a codebase has endured.
Each code save-point in version control (known as a commit) is labeled
with a message which is generally used to describe what semantic meaning
the change has, who wrote it, when it was wrote, and what exactly was
changed. It may not be the most intuitive tool to learn how to use, but
it has been embraced by the professional and open source software
development communities, with GitHub hosting over 35 million git and
subversion repositories from 14 million users <span class="citation">GitHub (2016)</span>.</p>

<p>Both of these collaboration methods provide unique benefits to
programmers, but there has not been major implementations of
collaborative programming systems which combine these two methods.
CodePilot supports both real-time and non-real-time collaborative
editing, finally bringing together real-time programming and
non-real-time collaboration. It allows its users to import a repository
of code from GitHub and start collaborating synchronously on a project,
and still periodically commit updated versions.</p>

<h2 id="scaling-human-effort">Scaling Human Effort</h2>

<p>The wisdom of the Fred Brooks’ classic ’The Mythical Man Month’ is
relevant here. The larger a software team grows, the more overhead in
communication and synchronization there is. People are less able to
collaborate effectively on a project due to this overhead <span class="citation">Brooks (1995)</span>. The relationship between workers
and productivity in software is complex: perhaps 2 workers could
complete a project faster than a single worker, but what about 200
workers? Designing and writing software is an incredibly complex
process, and combining this with the coordination required for software
teams to work efficiently may actually make smaller teams perform better
than larger teams. According to Brooks, there are four essential
difficulties that the essence of software contains:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><em>Invisibility</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>software’s function is hard to visualize, thus hard to cognize</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><em>Changeability</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>even after release, software is under pressure to be modified</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><em>Conformity</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>requirements and interfaces man-made and not standardized</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><em>Complexity</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>abstractions eliminate redundant parts of code, each part unique</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>CodePilot aims to tackle some of the challenges presented from these
difficulties. CodePilot increases visibility through its web renderer,
allowing programmers to see the representation of their code. It handles
changeability with its operational transform syncing mechanism and the
GitHub-backed repository branching and version control. It encourages
conformity with its HTML, CSS, and Javascript debugger and its GitHub
issue integration, by allowing revisions of the software to be examined
and marked with any errors that are found. Complexity is not directly
handled by CodePilot, but other tools such as Python Tutor offer
in-browser tools that help with both invisibility and better
understanding complexity even if not reducing it <span class="citation">Guo (2013)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="online-compilation">Online Compilation</h2>

<p>Web browsers are an essential part of modern computer use, and
developers frequently use them to access the internet, looking up
documentation or asking questions on StackOverflow <span class="citation">Brandt et al. (2009)</span>. Increasingly, sites have
come out such as HackerRank, Interview Cake or Python Tutor which allow
users to evaluate dynamic code execution in the browser. One limitation
of these sites is that they usually limit evaluation targets to code
snippets that cannot be very complex. There is very limited support for
executing larger projects, although continuous integration testing sites
such as Travis-CI allow this.</p>

<p>Dynamic user interfaces are not easily tested, but our feedback
generation tool captures a significant amount of relevant information
about the page, creates a GitHub link with the entire state of the page
and provides a link for the issue to be re-rendered and examined by
others in the future. It does not entirely address software complexity,
since evaluating the correctness of code automatically in the browser is
a problem that is not fully solved. There exist tools such as Travis CI
for running tests or other linters which exist to check for code syntax
correctness but CodePilot doesn’t address these. CodePilot allows novice
programmers to use version control together, in a manner that promotes
self-efficacy and reduces frustration. CodePilot’s integrated
development tools, namely the testing and issues integration, fosters
task parallelization between team members.</p>

<h2 id="thesis-overview">Thesis Overview</h2>

<p>The key findings are that a mix of real-time and non-real-time version control
systems can improve novice programmers sense of self-efficacy when using
version control systems, and also that they can be used to help parallelize
software development and reduce the amount of unnecessary merge conflicts. We
will discuss relevant collaborative editors, pair programming and education
research, the sync-async collaboration paradigm, the CodePilot system
implementation, evaluation of the CodePilot system, results of the evaluation
study, discussion of study results, and finally conclusions and future work.</p>

<h1 id="cha:related">Related Work</h1>

<p>A good amount of relevant work has been done on other real-time
collaborative editors, as well as editors that integrate more blended
forms of asynchronous and synchronous collaboration features. There are
also relevant studies of how people work best together on software
projects, along with studies of how effective different types of pairs
of students are together. This body of work was influential on the
design of CodePilot. Collaborative learning and education is an active
area of research which explores how students best work together. This
work effects teaching practices, and therefore students who later become
developers who collectively shape industry practice.</p>

<h2 id="collaborative-editors">Collaborative Editors</h2>

<p>Increasingly, code is stored and distributed on GitHub, the popular git
repository hosting website. It can act as a library of guides and
example code for beginners to work through. GitHub also offers a
dedicated educational tool, GitHub Classroom, allowing programmers to
easily learn both version control and coding fundamentals <span class="citation">GitHub (2016)</span>. Even so, this often focuses on
non-real time collaboration or single developer workflows. Still, there
is exciting work being done on how collaborative editors can allow
programmers to work together more effectively both synchronously and
asynchronously.</p>

<p>There have been numerous editor plugins that aimed to provide a syncing
mechanism for programmers, such as <span class="math"><em>CollabVS</em></span>
<span class="citation">Hegde and Dewan (2008)</span> and <span class="math"><em>ATCoPE</em></span> <span class="citation">Fan, Sun, and Shen
(2012)</span>, for Visual Studio and Eclipse specifically. These are
less tied to version control than CodePilot, and mainly provide a real
time syncing mechanism. More recently, there is MadEye and Cloud9 - web
editors that allow you to share your session with someone else <span class="citation">MadEye (2016; Cloud9 2016)</span>. MadEye is backed by
your computer’s file system while Cloud9 allows you to import one of
your repositories from GitHub, but not to commit back. Both of these
make great improvements over traditional pair programming schemes, but
are designed for simply dropping in and solving an issue with the code.
This focus on larger software teams collaborating opportunistically
differs from the ’co-piloting’ pair programming scheme.</p>

<p>One notable system that provides a similar intermediate mix of real-time
and non-real-time collaboration is Collabode <span class="citation">Goldman, Little, and Miller (2011)</span>, which
allowed users to have concurrent editors, but filtered out the error
messages a single user would see to those that they themselves had
generated. Merging actual copies of divergent copies of code could be
delayed until the errors generated from the changes had been resolved,
efficiently combining real-time changes with a software verification
gating system. Other tools such as Syde seek to better synchronize
developer awareness by providing contextual awareness beyond version
control changes, by notifying developers of changes in source code in
real time <span class="citation">Hattori and Lanza (2010)</span>.</p>

<p>Developers use the internet as a resource to learn and remind themselves
of coding concepts or syntax. Some developers even reported visiting the
same site many times, acting as a sort of external memory bank. As the
code stored on the internet grows, example-centric programming will
become more popular, as developers fork relevant code and modify it to
their ends <span class="citation">Brandt et al. (2009; Brandt et al.
2010)</span>. A web IDE such as CodePilot allows and encourages this
information to be cached and accessed with less of a major context
switch, as the user remains in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="pair-coding-dynamics">Pair Coding Dynamics</h2>

<p>In a large quantitative study, code produced from pair programming
contained fewer bugs, leading to overall higher quality code <span class="citation">Williams et al. (2000)</span>. With this in mind,
CodePilot sought to retain these benefits while allowing work to speed
up by enabling two drivers (rather than having one person only monitor
the driver’s actions).</p>

<p>There is also something to be said about the social dynamics of working
together, specifically between pairs in pair programming <span class="citation">Thomas, Ratcliffe, and Robertson (2003)</span>. If
there is a mutual perception of technical capabilities, then pairs
worked better together. This is opposed to pairs where skilled
programmers work with novice programmers. Furthermore, students with a
good amount of confidence enjoy the pair programming experience most and
students did their best work when working with similarly skilled
programmers <span class="citation">Katira, Williams, and Osborne
(2005)</span>. The skill metric was self reported, and five
self-described warriors still got less under a <span class="math">50%</span> in the class. Overall, students liked pair
programming and believe that it helped them achieve effective solutions.</p>

<p>Side by side programming is another paradigm where people are at
adjacent workstations, and both work on coding, differs from co-piloting
code. (which would be pair programming but the other workstation focuses
on testing, version control, and reference hunting). They cite a study
comparing distributed and co-located pair programming: distance does not
matter. Also relevant is concurrent programming and browsing - one
person codes, the other person reviews the code or requirements
documents <span class="citation">Dewan et al. (2009)</span>. Another
programming paradigm is a rapid development cycle in which two
developers work together in test-driven development, where one of them
will work primarily on the implementation and one of them will work
primarily on the tests. This idea was tested with the Collabode system,
and the developers reported that this split was very natural <span class="citation">Goldman and Miller (2010)</span>. CodePilot’s
pilot/copilot methodology was originally inspired by this work.</p>

<p>Systems such as FASTDash <span class="citation">Biehl et al.
(2007)</span> pioneered a dashboard for keeping developers up to date on
what part of a project they are working on as early as 2007, before Git
or other distributed version control systems had started to balloon in
popularity. In a similar vien, PatchWorks provides an interesting
methodology on methods for allowing easier navigation of code <span class="citation">Henley et al. (2014)</span>. While CodePilot simply
uses a standard single pane text editor, working with more advanced
views of code could be integrated into CodePilot. This could be a shared
view that shows which portion of code is currently being viewed by your
collaborator.</p>

<p>There is also the option of having many people contribute to the
codebase, rather than a few trusted collaborators. Systems such as
CrowdCode <span class="citation">LaToza et al. (2014)</span> exhibit the
feasibility of this approach. Fleshing out psuedocode, creating unit
tests, and writing additional documentation for a codebase can be
effectively distributed many workers, given the appropriate back-end
coordination system.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-in-education">Collaboration in Education</h2>

<p>Computing education is growing in popularity, as a new CS for all
initiative was launched recently. However, coding is not done in pure
isolation, and nearly all production software involves a great deal of
collaboration between developers. While there has been much effort in
analyzing how content or presentation may be augmented, it is important
to also focus on how the methods of collaboration can be improved. When
used in educational setting, pair programming serves as effective
collaborative learning instance <span class="citation">Preston
(2006)</span>.</p>

<p>Work has been done that suggests that activity streams with individual
programming assignments can positively influence learning outcomes.
People are more likely to use a ’stream’ (forum) if integrated into
their programming experience, which they implemented with Visual Studio
<span class="citation">Hundhausen, Carter, and Adesope (2015)</span>.
Social programming environments are have been introduced, focusing on
the programmer’s sense of community and ability to communicate with
others, which are very important in educational environments <span class="citation">Hundhausen and Carter (2014)</span>. This served as a
guide when implementing the activity feed.</p>

<p>Pair programming can also be a effective to spread expertise among
programmers, which is useful information for both industrial and
computing education professionals. This adds to the value that
programming together has, adding more weight to the argument that
collaborating with others not only produces more ideas and potential
solutions but also can be a form of training and educating programmers
<span class="citation">Jones and Fleming (2013)</span>. When pair
programming, students tend to get stuck less and explore ideas more.
Contrastingly, students reported that when programming alone they were
more confident and understood their programs better after they were done
<span class="citation">Simon and Hanks (2008)</span>. CodePilot seeks to
strike a middle ground between these two workflow patterns.</p>

<p>Implementing a curriculum where students can collaborate on projects
early on can lead to much better retention rates, both in the class and
the major <span class="citation">Williams et al. (2003)</span>.
Additionally, web based IDE’s such as JavaGrinder strip away the tedium
of setting up development environments and allow programmers to worry
more about the execution of their code <span class="citation">Flieger
and Palmer (2010)</span>. Using the JavaGrinder was as web IDE while
pair programming has been found to positively effect student retention
in introductory computer science classes. CodePilot can help support
this by fostering more collaboration.</p>

<h1 id="cha:system">CodePilot: Git Realtime Collaboration</h1>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>We hypothesize that combining both real-time and non-real-time
collaborative tools will lead to a richer and more cohesive
collaborative programming experience, as opposed to either of those
methods alone. Synchronous editing, such as that supported by Google
Docs, is excellent at keeping collaborators in tune with what each other
is working and focusing on. Seeing edits performed in real time gives a
sense of dynamism to the work being done, and allows potential
misunderstandings to be cleared easily by presenting the same shared
context. The model of collaboration for CodePilot is shown in , where
the shared editor’s contents are being synced in real-time across
multiple users.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file-flow.png" alt="CodePilot File Flow Pattern" /> CodePilot File Flow Pattern</p>

</div>

<p>Issues can arise if communications between programmers editing the same
codebase suffer significant delay. A common trope of multi-developer
version control scenario is the commonality of the merge conflict. This
often happens when a certain part of a file has been changed by two
different developers, inadvertently stepping on each other’s toes.
Before the second developer pulls from the main repository host (GitHub,
Bitbucket, etc.), another developer pushes a commit. When the second
developer makes another commit locally (based on the last seen commit
from GitHub) and tries to push it to GitHub, they might see an error
like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>To https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
 error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git'
 To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
 Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then as suggested, they may try to pull and merge only to see a variant
of this error message:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in &lt;fileName&gt;
 Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This frustrates programmers since they simply want to share their work
with their teammates, but now they must coordinate with the first
committer and resolve the merge conflict by manually by creating a new
version of the code from the two branches which incorporates both
changes, or rebasing the head of their local branch off of the newly
updated remote and then merging in the changes again. The benefit of
synchronous collaboration systems is that there are <em>no merge
conflicts</em>. The syncing mechanism (such as Operational Transform)
automatically merges the changes coming in from each programmer and
keeps a single persistent document for all collaborators. A diagram of
the differences in merging strategies is shown in the figure below.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="merge-conflict.png" alt="Difference Between CodePilot and Standard DVCS Merge" /> Difference Between CodePilot and Standard DVCS Merge</p>

</div>

<p>This is not to say that the synchronous collaborative editor is the perfect
programming tool. Conversely, asynchronous collaboration through version
control provides its users with the ability to update their versions of the
codebase as they please, rather than keeping a single persistent shared state.
The interactions between GitHub and CodePilot’s servers is shown in the figure
below. Collaboration with version control through platforms such as GitHub and
Bitbucket has been steadily growing more popular, and will likely continue to
be a way that future developers collaborate together on software projects.
There is often a significant overhead when learning to use git outside of a
single developer context for budding coders, though. They are already building
their fundamental computer science skills, on top of learning how to use git or
mercurial. Merging divergent repository copies distracts them from the ’meat’
of the programming, although learning how to use version control systems
effectively is an increasingly important skill, corresponding with their
usage’s rising popularity.</p>

<p>CodePilot aims to take the best of real-time and non-real-time systems
and combine them in a system that is more intuitive for novice
programmers. CodePilot also strives to facilitate collaborators’
awareness of each other’s activity without hindering or distracting any
collaborators that use it. This mix between two prevalent paradigms is
demonstrated in the above figure.</p>

</div>

<p>The ability to verify that code is working as expected is a fundamental
part of the software development process, and any capable web IDE
(integrated development environment) will provide some means of doing
so. While there have been efforts to compile and evaluate code in the
browser, the latency between running your code and seeing the results is
still quite high. However, the technology in this domain continues to
improve, and may reach the point where the simplicity and latency no
longer dissuades developers from using online IDEs.</p>

<h2 id="system-overview">System Overview</h2>

<p>CodePilot (currently found at <a href="http://codepilot.xyz">codepilot.xyz</a>) is
a Meteor Javascript application that provides project wide real time
collaborative editing, using shareJS as a back-end syncing library <span class="citation">Meteor (2016; ShareJS 2016)</span>. It allows users to
import a repository of code from GitHub. Once this is complete, they can
edit their project and make a new commit based on their edited version
of the document and push the new version back to GitHub. Once a
repository has been updated on GitHub, changes can be pulled in from the
head of a branch, along with whatever commits that have occurred since
the last time CodePilot updated its local copy of the repository.</p>

<ul>
  <li>supports simultaneous file editing</li>
  <li>import any GitHub repo into codepilot</li>
  <li>edit, test, and commit back to GitHub</li>
  <li>supports live branching, testing</li>
  <li>import, create, and close issues</li>
  <li>includes screenshot, live code</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="codepilot.png" alt="CodePilot Basic Programming Interface" /> CodePilot Basic Programming Interface</p>

</div>

<p>CodePilot is a tool meant to help people collaborate on code more
seamlessly. The collaboration model was based on that of a pilot and a
co-pilot, where the pilot does most of the actual programming, and the
co-pilot performs background coding tasks. In general, this is loosely
enforced, instead opting for interface differences to suggest activities
more or less prominently based on the user’s role. This can include
version control management, system testing, online reference lookup, and
commenting or documenting source code. A screenshot of the main
programming interface is shown in the above figure.</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>

<p>When users first login, they see a link to the configuration panel where they
can change which repository and branch they are working on. A list of the files
in the repository is presented, with a prompt to begin editing them. This
interface is shown in the figure below. Coming back to the main coding page in
the future will simply show the file that was opened last.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="setup.png" alt="CodePilot New User Welcome Panel" /> CodePilot New User Welcome Panel</p>

</div>

<p>Clicking on the setup link above will bring them configuration page, where
users are able to select which repository and branch they would like to work
on. This setup panel is shown in the figure below. They are also able to view
additional information about their account, such as who the other CodePilot
collaborators are for their current repository, a link to the GitHub account
that created their CodePilot profile, and the option to select which role they
would have in the development process. These roles were designed to guide
parallel development, encouraging the pilot to take charge of the software
development process and the copilot to help with testing, documentation, and
source control. The UI for the copilot does not contain the commit panel, and
the order of the testing pane was rearranged to feature the issues and tasks
more prominently. The motivation for this was that to make collaboration even
easier, a link could be generated that could be sent to anyone, who can drop in
on your session without having to login in or be a collaborator of the GitHub
repository. This functionality was not built out however, so the interface
differences previously mentioned are the only differences between pilots and
copilots.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="config.png" alt="CodePilot Configuration Panel" /> CodePilot Configuration Panel</p>

</div>

<p>The actual editing pane is based on the popular Ace web editor, which features
language recognition, syntax highlighting, and code auto-completion (shown in
the figure below). A syncing library (ShareJS <span class="citation">ShareJS
(2016)</span>) is used to relay edits back to the server and then to all other
connected users working on this same project. The file name and path are listed
in the upper left corner of the pane, with testing and saving buttons in the
upper right. This is to provide easy access to the other cycles of the software
development process.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="program.png" alt="CodePilot Autocompletion Example" /> CodePilot Autocompletion Example</p>

</div>

<h2 id="activity-feed">Activity Feed</h2>

<p>CodePilot has an integrated activity and chat feed which updates in real
time with the actions of each collaborator. Notifications appear when
anyone creates a file, renames a file, opens a file, creates an issue,
closes an issue, switches branches, makes a commit, and switches in or
out of a repo. It also features a link to opening up a Google Hangouts
session where you can video or audio chat with others collaborating on
this repository in CodePilot. This feature of CodePilot is displayed in
the the task list below.</p>

<p>Tasks are able to created, completed and optionally deleted by collaborators.
This system is designed to help outline the work that remains to be done. In
the left side of each task there is a small label which displays the username
of the task’s creator, visible in the figure below. Working with tasks also
triggers the activity feed to update, so the main programmer can see the tasks
and links coming in.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="tasks.png" alt="CodePilot Task List" /> CodePilot Task List</p>

</div>

<h2 id="code-testing">Code Testing</h2>

<p>The testing framework inside CodePilot is geared towards debugging basic
websites that include HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This decision was made
primarily due to the ease of having the browser render these. Since the
browser is already made to render websites from these materials, we
hypothesized that it would be a most natural to render basic website
code since the synchronous nature of application best fit inside a web
browser. Shown in is a screenshot of CodePilot’s testing pane. It
features links back to the coding pane, an option to reload code from
the editor and re-render it, and a button to move to the full screen
debugger. A choice was made to separate the code that was being edited
and that which was being inspected in the renderer so it would not reset
on a tester who was inspecting the code every time that their partner
typed in a new character.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="debugger.png" alt="CodePilot Web Interface Debugger" /> CodePilot Web Interface Debugger</p>

</div>

<p>When you enter the testing pane and press the reload button, the code
that is in the editor is ported into a difference cache, and injected
into CodePilot’s renderer. This allows the pilot to keep making changes
while the tester debugs the code that was loaded into the browser,
making it easier for the work to be done in parallel. Any change that
was made by the pilot will not be loaded into the renderer until the
reload button is pressed.</p>

<p>Inside the debugging pane, an iframe with injected code renders the
users code, parsed from the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files found in
their project. The division with text ’beginning console output’ is
actually the where console.log and console.error are directed to based
on the iframes template, which overrides these functions. This way, the
developers can easily view the output of their code while debugging. It
also features support for jQuery, the popular Javascript library that
makes accessing the DOM tree more direct. Below that is the actual
rendering of the user’s code. Finally, in the top-right corner there is
a report issue button, which is hooked into GitHub issues and allows
users to easily track problems with their code, or make clear certain
parts of the site that they want to change. The issue tracker records
all of the state of the rendering, and when an issue is generated (such
as in ), it includes a link back to the live, rendered, version of the
website. This tool could be used by clients who want to highlight
certain aspects of their site that need to be changed, or by students
seeking feedback on their website’s overall design.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="issue-gen.png" alt="CodePilot Web Interface Issue Recorder" /> CodePilot Web Interface Issue Recorder</p>

</div>

<p>These issues (along with any issues imported from GitHub) are displayed
in the CodePilot testing pane. Once you click an issue, a dropdown
button list is shown, allowing users to view the issue on GitHub, close
the issue (both in CodePilot and in GitHub), and if the issue was
generated by CodePilot view the live demonstration of the rendered web
code. This interface is shown in the above figure.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="issues.png" alt="CodePilot Issue Management Interface" /> CodePilot Issue Management Interface</p>

</div>

<p>This is because when an issue is created, the content of each aspect of
the renderer (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and console output) is saved, and
can be reloaded into the renderer template. This issue will be visible
to everyone working on the repository (or if it is a public repository,
then the entire public). An example issue that was generated by
CodePilot is shown in as it appears on GitHub. Additionally, the link to
the live version where the issue was found does not require users to be
logged in with CodePilot, so if there are other collaborators using the
standard git platform, they are still able to view and understand the
issue.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="github-issue.png" alt="CodePilot Issue’s GitHub Appearance" /> CodePilot Issue’s GitHub Appearance</p>

</div>

<p>It should be noted that this testing approach is much more general than
web development. Nothing prevents this from being extended to any
language or automated testing framework. We chose HTML/CSS/JS since web
development is most natural in this setting, but it could have been
Ruby, Python, C++, or any other language. The testing here could feature
sending the code to a server to run test cases, or even compiling to
Javascript in the browser in the future with Opal, Emscripten, or other
Javascript source compilers <span class="citation">Opal.rb (2016;
Emscripten 2016)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>

<p>Users are able to select and import any repository that they are a collaborator
on, or repositories that their organization owns and they have access to. This
selection pane is shown in the figure below. In addition to this, they are able
to easily fork any existing repository (through the GitHub API), and begin
working on that in Codepilot. Branches can also be browsed and selected, so
that you are able to work on any branch from GitHub. Users are also able to
create a new branch based off the your current CodePilot branch, and this
change is immediately synced back to with GitHub.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="repos.png" alt="CodePilot Repository Selection Interface" /> CodePilot Repository Selection Interface</p>

</div>

<p>Once a repository is imported, you can use the programming interface to
edit the contents of any text files that are located. Images in project
repositories may be opened, but no interface is provided to edit them.
Once any change is loaded into the renderer or the refresh button is
pressed, a difference will be generated.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="filetip.png" alt="CodePilot File Management Interface" /> CodePilot File Management Interface</p>

</div>

<p>This is similar to the output that you would see if had entered ’git
diff’ on the command line, although it is integrated directly into
CodePilot. There is a small reset button in the top right section of
each diff, so that the user may reset changes that were made but does
not want to commit. There is also an ‘import master’ button, which shows
the name of whatever branch is currently being developed in CodePilot.
This will pull down the latest commits from GitHub and load that version
of the project into CodePilot.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="diffing.png" alt="CodePilot Code Diffing Interface" /> CodePilot Code Diffing Interface</p>

</div>

<p>The commit panel is only visible to pilots, excluding copilots. This
goes with our theme of having the main pilot have the final say over
what gets committed, but allowing others to help out on the code. Once a
commit has been made, the differences will be reset, and the commit that
was just created and pushed will be added to the list of commits in both
CodePilot and GitHub. This is demonstrated in the figure below.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="commit.png" alt="CodePilot Commit Interface" /> CodePilot Commit Interface</p>

</div>

<p>Again, it should be noted that this version control approach is more
general than just pilot/copilot as we use them here. There is the
possible use case of having a single main developer who frames the code
and specifications, then guides other developers as they implement the
basics. Additionally, this system could be used in a scenario where the
pilot seeks help on a specific problem, and allows a copilot to enter
the session and try to solve it. The pilot still retains the sole access
to push new versions of code to GitHub, but can now seek help from a
broader pool of developers.</p>

<h1 id="cha:eval">Evaluation</h1>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>We developed <span class="math"><em>CodePilot</em></span>, a real time
collaborative text editor with GitHub integration. We wanted to test
whether this tool allows novice programmers to effectively use the git
version control system in a collaborative environment, and whether the
development tools inside CodePilot encourage members to parallelize
their development efforts.</p>

<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>

<p>We recruited six pairs of students that were familiar with both web
development and version control to participate in an 1 hour study
evaluating how CodePilot performed as a collaborative development tool.
We also took screen recordings of 10 out of the 12 study participants.
The reason for not recording screencasts of the last 2 participants was
that they did not have any screen recording software installed, and we
were not prepared with a screen recorder for their operating system. To
avoid the study going over the allotted time, we continued without
recording the screens of these two participants. All were fairly
experienced with version control and web development, as shown in and .
The study had eight male and four female students. There were two
graduate students, six seniors, three juniors, and one sophomore,
represented in the figures below.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

<p>Each hour long pair programming session was structured as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explanation of the study and its purpose</li>
  <li>Signing of study consent forms</li>
  <li>Demonstrating CodePilot features</li>
  <li>Starting screen recorder software</li>
  <li>Signing in, linking with GitHub</li>
  <li>Collaborating on web development (30 min.)</li>
  <li>Interviewing about experience (15 min.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Participants were assigned the following web programming tasks with a
single teammate (emulating pair programming), and encouraged to complete
as many of them as possible in a 30 minute time frame that was allocated
in the middle of the experimental session. The original repo with
instructions can be found here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/jeremywrnr/cp-evaluation">https://github.com/jeremywrnr/cp-evaluation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Styling (CSS)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>horizontally center the h2 class</li>
  <li>set the background color to something dark</li>
  <li>set the text color to something light</li>
  <li>make the text change color when you hover over it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure (HTML)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>create an h2 heading with both your names</li>
  <li>make an unordered list with an id of weather</li>
  <li>make an h3 heading with an id of average</li>
  <li>change the title to be ’recent weather’</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data (Javascript)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>open the JQuery.getJSON
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON">documentation</a></li>
  <li>using this method, parse a hosted json weather data</li>
  <li>add each data point as items to our weather list</li>
  <li>compute the average temperature from this data set</li>
  <li>display this temperature in our temperature heading</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon completion or the passing of 30 minutes from when the tasks were
started, the first person who forked the repository would make a final
commit of what they had to their version of the forked original
repository. Each participant would then complete a brief interview
together about their experiences developing with CodePilot was like.
They also were asked to complete a demographic survey afterwards, which
asked about their student status (year), gender, and web programming and
version control experience. We also performed a short interview of both
partners after programming together to learn more about their experience
interacting with the system. The aim of this interview was to gain
insight into our subject’s ease of collaboration with CodePilot, their
awareness of their collaborator’s actions, their sense of self-efficacy
while collaborating and other general CodePilot feedback.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>When each pair of students first arrived at the session, we discussed
what the study would go over, had them sign consent forms for
participating as part of our IRB review process, and then gave them an
overview of CodePilot. They were instructed that they could leave at
anytime and there would be no negative repercussions for them. After the
initial overview and our CodePilot explanation and demonstration, they
were given a set of web development tasks, divided up into the structure
of the page (HTML), the style of the page (CSS), and the data and
interactivity of the page (Javascript). The focus is less on what the
task is though, and more on how they worked together to more efficiently
complete these tasks. One could note that the division of these tasks
could have lent itself to easier pair programming, since the tasks were
already categorized into the type of work they required and also the
file that work would be done in.</p>

<p>In hindsight, it would have been ideal to perform this study on public
Mac computers, since those would have screen recording software built
in, and did not want to take time to install additional screen recording
software. Thus our data is somewhat fragmented, as we cannot entirely
quantify the actions of those last two participants. Ample qualitative
notes were taken during the study however, and there was at least one
screencast generated per session. Through the study, we measured the
amounts of commits (total and per team member). For those that were able
to provide a screencast, we measured their time on task, the amount of
web searches, and the amount of context switches from their screen
recordings of their study sessions.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<h3 id="ease-of-collaboration">Ease of Collaboration</h3>

<p>After the collaborative programming session, each pair was interviewed
about what their experience using CodePilot to collaborate on web
development was like. They were also asked about how it compared to more
traditional, asynchronous collaborative workflows (namely collaboration
using git or other distributed version control systems). Some
participants appreciated the ability to see each other’s changes in
real-time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think its like a different kind of workflow. We were only able to do
that because we were right next to each other at the same time… like
for that, I think it was really great. It was great for pair
programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked how making commits was with CodePilot when working with other
people, there was a resounding positive response: “Committing was really
easy, it worked well”. When compared to GitHub, one participant felt
that GitHub would continue to be the premier method of long term hosting
for large scale projects, but that he preferred CodePilot’s synchronous
features when collaborating with someone in real time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub is always going to be the collaboration tool for large scale
projects, but if you want to real time collaborate, this is perfect.
GitHub is definitely not for real time, I am not expecting to
collaborate on the same code at the same time, or there will be a ton
of merge conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked if they had used version control with other’s before and
found themselves in situations where it held them back from actually
working effectively on their code, one answered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yea. Sometimes it can get in the way if you are trying to get
something done and there is a merge conflict it just takes more time,
its annoying. If the person is not familiar with git, that’s just
another thing on its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another echoed that, while also noting some of the downsides that come
with real time synchronization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was nice to see changes being made in real time. There wasn’t that
much of an issue with the other person typed and what I see on the
screen, so that was very helpful because it allows you to see what the
other person is doing which then avoids other issues, where you might
be doing the same work at the same time, or avoiding a merge conflict.
Of course the downside of that is that you are both working on the
same thing, and you can’t see their cursor so it was hard to
experiment often; kind of difficult to do work simultaneously,
especially if someone is doing work in the same file above or below
you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked about if they had to work with another programmer who was not
as experienced with version control if this would be a helpful tool,
participants again agreed that it would be much easier to use than
teaching that person all of how to use git, avoiding the headache of
merge conflicts. Finally, another student told of how they had branched
off on a project when working with others, and the large amount of merge
conflicts when they tried to bring in their code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s definitely been an issue for me… I branched pretty early,
worked on my own thing for a week, then tried to back together and the
merge conflicts were just kind of ridiculous… We ended up having to
do some git acrobatics, we were cherry picking things and putting them
back in the master branch. It would have been nice to a synced up
version with other collaborators in the first place so we didn’t have
to deal with then spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to
get someone else’s changes back in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our participants maintained that version control is an essential skill
which is worth learning, but can be challenging at first. One suggested
that a system as CodePilot could be nice to include novice programmers,
slowly introducing them to version control concepts such as commits and
branches (which CodePilot supports):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Git is super useful to fully know… but that being said, this is
definitely a good starting place so that they can at least have the
idea that a commit is a save point in the code that they can go back
to, and then later on introduce branches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overall, using a synchronous editor was found to be better at keeping
developers in the same context than a standard distributed workflow,
where programmers edit different code bases and then later merge them
together. On the other hand, there is the chance that something will be
edited by your collaborator, which would then impact what you were
working on. Collabode has done interesting work with supports optional
merging only after a partner’s code has passed a test compilation, which
could lead to an optimal balance of knowing what your fellow developers
are doing without it impeding what you are working on <span class="citation">Goldman, Little, and Miller (2011)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="awareness-of-collaborators">Awareness of Collaborators</h3>

<p>One of the benefits of having a broad web editor is the diminished need
to perform context switching, and the corresponding avoidance of mental
flow disruptions. Your partner can easily send you relevant links or
even create a branch from the current system without having to distract
you from whatever coding task you are working on. When asked if they had
a good sense of what their teammate was doing, students responded
positively, noting that the integrated activity feed () helped them stay
synced up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like even without the cursor syncing, the fact that the log
says ’[partner] opened site.js’ or ’[partner] committed css’ was
really helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Participants tended to immediately divide up the work and then work on
the separate parts right from the initial starting up. Several times
they discussed which part they were currently working on, confirming
that they would not be editing each other’s work. This would not be a
conflict in traditional development workflows, but you would still face
the problem of later merging code back into the central hosted
repository and resolving whatever conflicts could be generated from
that.</p>

<p>One feature that multiple participants requested in these interviews
were the ability to see where their collaborators cursors were in each
file, similar to how Google Docs allows you to jump to where your
collaborator’s text selection or cursor is in the file.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the distribution of commits between team members was distributed
in a manner almost as if we had enforced the pilot and copilot programming
schemes. On almost every team, there was one person who took over the version
control duties, making all the commits as seen in the figure below. There was
one team where both partners authored and pushed commits back to GitHub, but
they verbally communicated this, so there was some additional communication.
This suggests that people work well when they split up the work, and make clear
roles for themselves even if they are not assigned.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="p-commits.png" alt="Participant Commits" /> Participant Commits</p>

</div>

<h3 id="incorporating-feedback">Incorporating Feedback</h3>

<p>When asked if using CodePilot was enjoyable to use, all participants
generally responded positively. One noted the unique workflow that it
encouraged:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, using it was a pretty pleasant experience, had a lot of fun.
I would be a little bit worried using that as an alternative to
version control, since I think it is important to learn how to use
version control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After conducting the surveys, we took the study participant’s feedback
into consideration and implemented several fundamental system
improvements and some basic user interface updates. We added the ability
to check out any single commit, or the head of the current branch that
they were on. This provided users more flexibility in the state of the
code that they were editing in the browser, if they wanted to check out
what the state of code was at a given commit.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file-reset.png" alt="CodePilot File Resetting Addition" /> CodePilot File Resetting Addition</p>

</div>

<p>This included improving the file contents difference recognition
mechanism, so users could preview what the differences were between the
cached version of their project and the last committed version from
GitHub. It also provides users with the options to reset a file back to
how it was from the last commit if they accidentally change a file that
they did not mean to change. This is shown in the figure above.</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="nocommit.png" alt="CodePilot Commit Prevention" /> CodePilot Commit Prevention</p>

</div>

<p>We also improved the commit interface, notably disabling the ability to commit
anything if there were no differences between the current state of the project
in CodePilot and the latest version that was pulled in from GitHub, shown in
the figure above. Finally, we augmented navigation between code modes (editing,
testing, and saving) so that the switching was less of a mental barrier, and
allowed them to do so more easily. One of the most requested features in the
feedback was to be able to see their collaborators cursors, but this has not
been implemented at the time of writing.</p>

<h1 id="cha:concl">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Coding is increasingly collaborative, with the ever popular GitHub’s
motto being ’social coding’ <span class="citation">GitHub (2016)</span>.
No longer does the single genius hack away in isolation to bring about
the latest innovation. However, parallelization of software development
is an incredibly complex task, noted famously by Fred Brooks in the
mythical man month <span class="citation">Brooks (1995)</span>. As the
future generations of software developers gets trained, it is important
to reconsider how we work together on large pieces of complex software,
and to ponder on whether there are better ways that collaboration could
be done. Git’s versioning model is not necessarily intuitive immediately
for most new programmers, so an intermediate tool for collaborating on
code together could be helpful for them getting used to working with a
full fledged version control system such as git in a multi-developer
context.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<p>Other modes of task collaboration could be explored, such as
implementing a specification test from design documents, while others
begin writing the implementation. Frequent checks and syncing mechanisms
help avoid the large overhead of syncing massive code changes together.
While making commits frequently and atomically is broadly considered
best practice, more software can be developed that helps share and
encourage these best practices. Developers could begin to embrace a
broader set of collaborative models besides the traditional centralized
repository, expanding the abilities teams to work dynamically, and for
the relevant help to jump in more easily. CodePilot-style online
programming sessions could become more popular, to the point where
advanced developers could jump from session to session solving more
novice programmer’s issues. This could possibly be in return for a
financial reward, creating bounty hunter style developers. In order for
this to work there would be a need to objectively verify that the
software bug as described in however it was advertised had since been
removed after the novice was helped.</p>

<p>One very viable route that online code evaluations systems could proceed
in is extending CodePilot or other collaborative systems to allow the
execution of arbitrary code in a browser sandbox, or improve the
interfaces to back-end server compilers. Languages such as Ruby already
have an implementation in Javascript, the core language that modern web
browsers execute. This implementation is called Opal.js <span class="citation">Opal.rb (2016)</span>, and it compiles Ruby code into
Javascript which can then be evaluated directly in the browser without
having to ping a server to check the results. This could improve the
latency and lack of support for more complex projects in the software
verification cycle that hinders current online IDE’s most predominantly.</p>

<p>Currently, the committing pane of CodePilot where users make new commits
is limited to committing entire files (or sets of files). One
augmentation that could be done is to add functionality to commit just
part of a file’s changes, such as in ’git add –patch’ or ’git add
–interactive’ <span class="citation">Documentation (2016)</span>.
Furthermore, this augmented committing process could allow committing
all changes from a specific user (or a set of user). Each edit operation
already has an author identification tag, which could then used to
filter out which parts of the code to include in that commit.</p>

<p>There are also many improvements that could be made in terms of
shortening the feedback loop between editing code and inspecting the
differences in output. CodePilot’s HTML/CSS/JS renderer offered some
feedback loops, but there are already much more complex online code
running services, such as <a href="http://pythontutor.com/">pythontutor.com</a> for
visualizing code execution or Travis-CI for running an arbitrarily more
complex suite of tests. Systems such as Mad Eye already support sharing
access to your local machine’s terminal, thus avoiding the need for the
advanced helper to replicate the novice’s development system <span class="citation">MadEye (2016)</span>. There are potential security
issues with allowing other people direct access to your local machine
though, so perhaps with more limiting modifications this could be a
solid means of collaboration. Alternatively, the development environment
could be bundled up and then cloned in a web IDE, where it could run
actively. This is closer to what Cloud9’s web IDE seeks to provide,
where you are even give a limited BASH shell to run commands on the
remote server <span class="citation">Cloud9 (2016)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

<p>The contributions of this work are building and analyzing how future
modes of collaboration could be combined to work together to allow
developers to maintain a closer shared context without impeding each
other’s progress. This work explores new ways for collaborative
development to be less encumbering for budding programmers, and allow
for more parallelized development for experienced programmings.</p>

<p>As software development becomes more popular and collaborative, it is
important to examine the tools that people use to collaborate, along
with how these tools are actually used in practice. CodePilot is just
one example of a system that can extend how developers traditionally
work together, and lower boundaries to novice programmers when getting
involved with version control.</p>

<p>CodePilot combines synchronous and asynchronous collaboration,
encouraging a greater sense of awareness for what your collaborators are
working on, but this does not come without costs. Namely, the additional
context gained from synchronously editing files is offset by the
inability to edit code without effecting your collaborators. This can be
mitigated by compartmentalizing which codebase each person works on, or
splitting up collaborators so that one or two developers are mainly
writing code while others write tests or documentation.</p>

<p>Version control has made the world of software development a better
place, but is still often challenging to use when collaborating with a
large group. GitHub has done a great job in making it more accessible,
but there is still issues that people encounter when working together,
such as merging divergent copies of the repository. Tools can be built
(such as CodePilot) that bring together the asynchronous real-time
editor with that of the complex back-end version control system, as well
as some method of software verification, which was implemented using the
web renderer. CodePilot helps explore this increasingly viable and
important space of collaborative programming systems.</p>
