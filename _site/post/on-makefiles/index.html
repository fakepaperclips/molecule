<p>Earlier this semester, I sought and recruited the help of <a href="https://celehner.com/">Charles
Lehner</a> to write a script that would let me compile all
files with the ‘<em>.sp</em>’ extension using HSPICE, and put the command line output
into a file of the same name, but with an extension of ’<em>*.lis</em>’. This was for
a class on IC design I was taking
(<a href="http://www.ece.rochester.edu/courses/ECE222/syllabus.htm">ECE 222</a>)
in the spring of 2014.</p>

<p>I could not figure out how to do this with just a basic script, but he told me
of a program on most *NIX based systems called <em>make,</em> which was designed to
do exactly this sort of stuff.
<strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/jeremywrnr/11046931">Here</a></strong> is a link to the
makefile, which is run simply by entering the command ‘<em>make</em>’ in a folder
where there is a file called ’<em>Makefile</em>’.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can enter other commands that can be run via ‘<em>make _fakecommand
‘. By default, the command ‘_make</em>’ runs the first command found in the
makefile, and all other commands must be referenced with their command name. So
for example, the makefile linked above contains a command called clean, which
deletes all of the files ending with the ’*.lis’ extension. This is invoked by
entering ’<em>make clean</em>’.</p>

<p>One of the great things about this program is that before running on a file, it
checks to see if there have any changes in the file (which is the only case in
which it would be worth retesting them). In addition to HSPICE (netlist
compiler), I imagine this would be incredibly useful when running any sort of
code that is distributed over more than one file and requires compilation
(java, c, etc).</p>

<p>Anyways, this was incredibly convenient, and made my time dealing with HSPICE
slightly more bearable. Hats off to you Charlie!</p>
