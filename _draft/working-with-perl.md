My internship this summer has me doing a lot of Perl scripting, which is actually really useful and nice! In addition to the scripting I have been doing at work, I have reading a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Perl-Edition-Randal-Schwartz/dp/0596520107)&nbsp;on learning perl, which has a lot of exercises you can do to get more comfortable with Perl, and to give some practical experience actually implementing them. In order to better retain all of the info I am learning about Perl, I made a [github repo](https://github.com/jeremywrnr/perl_intro)&nbsp;with my solutions to exercises provided, along with some practical utilities I have made for managing files.

I have heard from friends/the internet that using python is actually much nicer, in that there is sometimes more clarity, and it is a more modern language (meaning that it was released after Perl). It is said to focus mostly on the best way to do things - I like the freedom that Perl gives you though. This difference can discerned after examining the differences of two their …uhh… associated long acronyms:

[Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) - TIMTOWTDI (_tim toady_), or also apparently - and more recently&nbsp;TIMTOWTDIBSCINABTE (_Tim Toady Bicarbonate_). Whew. Basically they mean you should be able to do \* in whatever way you want.

[Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TOOWTDI) - TOOWTDI (_tooty_) and the more explicit&nbsp; [TSBOAPOOOWTDI](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) (…_unknown&nbsp;pronunciation_). The difference here is that whatever you want to do, there should be only one (obvious) way to do it. This may initial implementation quicker, but for this to be true your functional tool set must have been reduced (relative to perl’s).
