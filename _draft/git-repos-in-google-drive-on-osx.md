git repos in google drive on OSX

I ran into a problem when I would initialize or move a git repo into Google
Drive (gd). Inside the .git folder, gd would place a bunch of OSX folder icon
files as ‘Icon?’. This occasionally messed up git for me, so in order to clean
out all of the 'Icon?’ files in my gd, I executed the following to first search
for all of the target files in my gd folder recursively:

    find ~/Google\ Drive/ -type f -iname 'Icon?'

If the list of files generated by the command above is acceptable, I used the
next command to actually delete them:

    find ~/Google\ Drive/ -type f -iname 'Icon?' -exec rm -v {}\;

Note that each time you open up any gd folder in Finder, more Icon? files may
be generated, so it can be convenient to make an alias for these commands. This
command is also useful if you want all the folders to match the yosemite color
scheme, as gd’s folder icon uses the mavericks color scheme, so it looks a bit
off.
