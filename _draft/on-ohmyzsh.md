ohmyzsh and more

I have recently been tweaking my terminal a lot, starting with
[ohmyzsh](http://ohmyz.sh/), which is a super easy way to start taking
advantage of some of the awesome autocomplete features and other nuances which
make development so much smoother and enjoyable. There are also many
[themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes)&nbsp;you can
use to customize how information is presented to you.

I also played around with the Terminal preferences pane, to improve the
readability of the prompt and the colors used. This included changing the
cursor to cyan, which helps a bunch when you are using vim or less and
searching a text file (all white text). See a glimpse below:

My dotfiles for this shell, and some other fun stuff, can be found
