joy of seil

I mapped my caps-lock key to Esc using
[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) /
[Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en), and my life has become
doubly joyful. I not only no longer TYPE LIKE THIS after hitting the caps-lock
key when searching for ‘a’, but I also get out of Insert mode in vim MUCH
easier… the Esc key is tiny on macs.&nbsp;
