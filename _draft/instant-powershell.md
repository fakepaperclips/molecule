instant powershell

Learned a pretty cool trick for windows users recently:

> _in explorer: “alt+d” -\> type powershell -\> enter_

This will open up a version of ms powershell, right where you are. I was
looking into doing this from the context menu at first, but it was somewhat
clunky and not really what I was looking for. Thankfully I stumbled across this
gem!
