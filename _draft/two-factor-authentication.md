two factor authentication

I recently set up two factor authentication with Google Authenticator for most
of my online accounts. Now, when I am logging into one of my accounts on an
_unrecognized&nbsp;_device, I will be prompted for a small code from the
Authenticator App on my phone.

The advantage of this technology is that even if someone cracks my password,
they will need a code (generally 6 or 7 random, time variant digits) from the
Authenticator app on my phone to sign in on an unrecognized device.&nbsp;

Considering the that my phone is generally by my side with itâ€™s own lock key,
this method provides a GREAT deal of added security to your account for only a
minor inconvenience. This is especially the case for my google account, which
is linked to my YouTube and is the backup account (where password reset emails
are sent) for all my other accounts.

For those that have not yet moved to space phones, there are many methods that
simply send the login code via SMS message.
