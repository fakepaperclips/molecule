launchy + weby

Launchy is a service that allows you to start programs (and pretty much do
everything else) via a quick, clean pop-up window. The window is generally
invoked with _‘Alt+Space’,_ and the layout and appearance are highly
customizable. Here is a screenshot of launchy in action. I entered 'word’ and
then pressed the down arrow key to see the full list of options.

In addition to extensive local usages, we can use a plugin for launchy (called
'weby’) to add custom web queries. Here is a look into my
_weby&nbsp;_configuration. (Hint: you can access the options screen of launchy
via a 'Ctrl + ,’ shortcut). ![image](https://33.media.tumblr.com/d358bcda374e847204aae2f073316b2f/tumblr_inline_n4fvkej0Tp1s7hh2w.jpg)

So basically the way this works is that the column on the left determines which
launchy will recognize the query with, and the column on the right determines
which url will be used in the query. The argument you give launchy is
represented as a _%1._ So here is an example, using a wolfram alpha query I set
up with _weby_. ![image](https://33.media.tumblr.com/e44defc62debd9a4fcbb895d8f801885/tumblr_inline_n4fvuwHzHI1s7hh2w.jpg)

I enter this is by typing _wolfram_, pressing _tab_, then typing _pikachu
curve_. Pressing enter will take me to a new web tab at wolfram alpha, with the
search argument of 'pikachu curve’. The beautiful results:

For more info on other queries you can set up, and more general info on
launchy, check out the sources below. There is a pretty cool one for taking you
to the compose screen of gmail, with the 'To’ field filled in with your given
argument. Thanks for reading!
